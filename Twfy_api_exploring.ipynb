       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a816.0/1\">I thank the Minister for advance sight of his statement, but with red lights flashing across the board, this is a weak attempt by the Government to defend their bungled expansion of childcare provision. The Opposition are absolutely clear in our commitment to building a modern childcare and early years education system, and are putting quality at the heart of our vision. We support the expanded entitlement, but there are serious questions about whether the Government&#8217;s plans are deliverable. Ever since the Chancellor&#8217;s announcement in the 2023 Budget, parents and the early years sector have been crying out for a detailed and credible plan for the roll-out of the expansion, but the Government have consistently dismissed concerns and acted as if there were no problems when the problems are clear to see.</p><p pid=\"a816.0/2\">Today&#8217;s statement is yet another desperate attempt by the Government to avoid scrutiny of their childcare plans; it comes just hours before what we understand to be a highly critical report from the National Audit Office. It would have been far better if the Minister had come to the House following the publication of the NAO report, so that hon. Members could properly scrutinise his response to it.</p><p pid=\"a816.0/3\">The Department&#8217;s own modelling suggests that an extra 85,000 childcare places and 40,000 additional full-time equivalent staff will be needed by September 2025. That is a huge challenge when providers across the country are already struggling to recruit the skilled staff that they need; many are on the brink of closure. The Department&#8217;s recently published pulse survey, which the Minister is quoting in aid, found that two thirds of all group-based providers and staff of school-based providers continued to experience staffing problems, with little change since 2022. Nine in 10 providers responding to the survey have either reduced the number of places that they offered last year, or kept the same number of places. Similarly, data from Ofsted shows that in the six months following the Chancellor&#8217;s original announcement, childcare places fell by more than 1,000. How can the Minister credibly claim that everything is on track when that is the feedback from the sector?</p><p pid=\"a816.0/4\">Coram&#8217;s annual survey of childcare providers is also clear about the Government&#8217;s failure. Just 28% of local authorities are confident that they will have enough places for the expansion to children from the age of nine months; that is almost three quarters of communities where parents will not be able to access the childcare that the Government have promised. Across every age group and category, Coram found a fall in the number of local authorities able to deliver sufficient childcare in their area. Some 87% of areas saw the workforce crisis as the biggest barrier to the expansion, but there is still no detailed workforce plan from the Government. Just 6% of areas are confident that they will have sufficient childcare for disabled children, which is a truly shameful failure.</p><p pid=\"a816.0/5\">We need a serious plan to ensure childcare expansion is a success for children, parents and providers. The Opposition are clear that we will be led by the evidence. That is why we have commissioned Sir David Bell to  review the challenges facing the sector and inform our plans for future reform. How many of the codes that the Minister&#8217;s Department issued in the April expansion have translated into provision of a childcare place? Where is the additional &#163;500 million of investment announced in the Budget being funded from, and what is being cut to provide that funding? What urgent discussions is he having with the early years sector about the impact of the April expansion on its financial sustainability? Will he guarantee today that every family will be able to access a childcare place following the planned further expansion in September&#8212;yes or no?</p><p pid=\"a816.0/6\">Children&#8217;s voices are not heard often enough in this place, so on their behalf, I warn Ministers: childcare and early education are too important to be put at risk by the mess they are making. The issue today is not simply about places, the staff in our nurseries or even work choices for parents, but life chances for our children. Ministers must, for the sake of all our children, get a plan in place now.</p>',\n",

Across the country, teachers, teaching assistants, support staff, speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, mental health professionals and many more work tirelessly every day to ensure that children with SEND have the best possible education.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/2\">I am grateful to hon. Members who have contributed to the debate, but I must pay particular tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Gen Kitchen\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/26288\">the Member for Wellingborough (Gen Kitchen)</phrase>. It really is to her credit that she has chosen this debate to make her maiden speech and to be that powerful voice for some of the most vulnerable children and most challenged families in her community. She is clearly a powerful advocate for her communities. If they vote her back in at the general election, they will also hopefully have a Labour Government with whom she can work to truly deliver on her &#8220;visit Wellingborough&#8221; campaign.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/3\">Since the passage of the Children and Families Act 2014, the number of requests for EHC plans has risen year on year, doubling between 2016 and 2022. There was a further 7% rise in 2022 when 66,706 new plans were issued. Almost 400,000 school pupils are now supported through an EHC plan, while a further 1.2 million children are receiving support without a plan. However, it is clear from today&#8217;s debate that the support system for children with SEND is failing too many children and their families. Parents and carers are being forced into expensive and lengthy battles to access the support they need throughout their children&#8217;s time in school. In 2022, more than half of EHC plans were issued after the 20-week target.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/4\">Increasingly, families are turning to the tribunal process&#8212;with a 24% increase in cases last year&#8212;to secure a plan or appeal the detail of their child&#8217;s plan. An overwhelming 98% of cases were won by parents and carers last year. That process is not only draining for families but expensive for the taxpayer. Research by the Disabled Children&#8217;s Partnership found that lost cases cost councils and courts &#163;60 million in 2021-22. We must not forget the families who do not even make it to the tribunal, and whose children&#8217;s needs are left unmet. These unacceptable delays are heartbreaking   for families, who face years of stress and anxiety while their child is unable to access the education to which they are entitled.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/5\">More than a third of children with SEND were persistently absent from school in the autumn and spring terms last year. Although some of that absence is related to the need for medical appointments, much is due to the lack of tailored provision for a child&#8217;s needs. Children with SEND have one of the largest attainment gaps compared with their peers. A child with an EHCP is on average 28 months behind their peers at the end of primary school. The gap only grows throughout school, to a staggering 3.5 years&#8212;40 months&#8212;by the time they leave. We only get one childhood, and delayed support will embed lifelong inequalities and create barriers to the opportunities that children can pursue later in life.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/6\">The crisis in SEND support is having a devastating impact on local authority finances, as hon. Members have touched on. Increasing numbers of councils are issuing section 114 notices, effectively declaring bankruptcy, with many citing the impact of increasing SEND and home-to-school transport costs as reasons. No council takes this lightly, and councillors and officers across the country working really hard to balance the books. I am sure that the Minister may want to blame specific councils for the issues, but the sheer number of local authorities on the brink&#8212;with administrations of all political parties&#8212;cannot be dismissed. Reforming the SEND system is vital not only for children and families but to ensure that the wider local government services across the country are sustainable. Issuing a section 114 notice has grave implications for the delivery of all local government services, and it is often children who suffer most from the resulting cuts.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/7\">The Government&#8217;s SEND and alternative provision review should have been the opportunity to set out an ambitious plan for reform to ensure the best outcomes for children with SEND, better relationships with families, and a sustainable system for schools and local authorities. Yet after a four-year wait, the plan was met with widespread disappointment with its limited scope. Many measures will not come into effect until 2025&#8212;six years after the review was announced. In that time, 300,000 children with SEND will have left school.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/8\">The funding for 15 new special schools in last week&#8217;s Budget is welcome, but the schools will provide additional places for just 2,000 children and there is no clear timeline for when they will open to students. I hope that the Minister will update the House on the other 33 new special schools announced alongside the SEND and alternative provision improvement plan. More than a year on from the publication of the plan, the Department has yet to publish the details of approved academy trusts, and that is delaying the start of construction. When does the Minister expect those schools to open for students?</p><p pid=\"d495.1/9\">It is also disappointing that the Budget had little to say more widely on support for children with SEND, the majority of whom will continue to be educated in the mainstream sector. The Opposition are committed to breaking down the barriers faced by children with SEND. We believe in high and rising standards for every child. We know that there are children with additional needs in every classroom in every school but, as has been highlighted by Members on the Government Benches, the Government do not equip every teacher with the knowledge and skills they need to teach them.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/10\">Labour would look at every aspect of teacher training&#8212;undergraduate curriculum, early career framework and career change routes&#8212;and we will introduce an entitlement to annual continuing professional development, which we would expect to be used in many instances to boost SEND expertise. As part of Labour&#8217;s planned reforms to Ofsted inspection, moving away from the use of single-word judgments will ensure that schools are inspected on their inclusivity and that parents of children with SEND have access to clear information about their child&#8217;s school.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/11\">Children increasingly start school without the foundational language and communication skills that they need to take part in their education. We are committed to improving speech and language support, and will equip every school with funding to deliver evidence-based early language interventions, such as Nuffield early language intervention. More than 280,000 children received SEND support last year for their social, emotional and mental health, while many children with mental ill health were out of school entirely. The need for mental health support has soared in recent years. Alongside urgent action to address the unacceptably high waiting times for CAMHS support, we will embed professional mental health support in every school and deliver open access youth mental health hubs in every community.</p><p pid=\"d495.1/12\">We will build a modern early education and childcare system that works for the families of disabled children. The early identification of needs is vital to provide the intervention in the most important years of a child&#8217;s development. Last year, Coram found that just 18% of local authorities had sufficient places for disabled children. Will the Minister confirm that there will be sufficient places for disabled children ahead of the expansion of entitlements in April?</p><p pid=\"d495.1/13\">Children and families deserve much better than Government sticking plaster solutions. We will work with parents, carers, schools and local authorities to rebuild the support that children with SEND rely on, and deliver the change needed to ensure that every child can thrive in school. For 14 years, the Government have failed children and families. As we have always done in government, Labour will put children first again.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"f208.1/1\">My hon. Friend is absolutely right about the challenges right across our SEND system&#8212;a system that the Secretary of State herself has described as &#8220;lose, lose, lose.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"f208.1/2\">School leaders know that this is a disaster, yet earlier this month the Department updated us all on the work of the workload reduction taskforce. It is not the work of teachers, the taskforce clarifies, to investigate a pupil&#8217;s absence. Teachers may do it&#8212;it is vital work that needs doing&#8212;but it also depends on our amazing support staff.</p><p pid=\"f208.1/3\">Labour&#8217;s plan to tackle the attendance crisis starts with our smallest children. It includes a childcare system modernised from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school, high-quality early education, a focus on life chances for children&#8212;not just on work choices for parents&#8212;and high and rising standards right from the start, with early language interventions to identify and remove barriers to learning, and a determination to reform the SEND system, to put money behind children, not lawyers, and to tackle issues before they hold children back, with a new focus on primary numeracy so that children love maths at six, never mind at 16&#8212;excellence for everyone; not for some of our children but for all of them. There will be free breakfast clubs in every primary school, because it is about the club, not just the breakfast. Every day, every child, every life and every start.</p><p pid=\"f208.1/4\">There will be 6,500 new qualified teachers and a new national voice for our support staff. Ofsted will be reformed and improved. We will end the high-stakes, low-information culture, with annual checks for attendance, safeguarding and off-rolling. There will be mental health counsellors in our secondary schools and new community hubs outside them, joining up the information that we have on our children so that every child can be supported between schools and services&#8212;every issue caught, shared and addressed. And we will fulfil the cause for which we asked for time today: a law to register and count the children who are out of school.</p><p pid=\"f208.1/5\">Labour is clear on how we will fund that package and the change that we need: by ending the tax breaks for private schools and the mega-rich. We will invest in what we most believe in: our children and their futures, excellence for everyone, high and rising standards, and a Britain where background is no barrier to opportunity. The legislation that we will introduce next month, with the House&#8217;s permission if today&#8217;s motion is agreed to, will be simple: it will be part 3 of the Government&#8217;s own Schools Bill from 2022, which provided for a register of children not in school. That is nothing that Conservative Members would not have been prepared to vote for had it been tabled by their own Ministers, so there can be no reason or excuse for Conservative Members who care  about this issue not to support the motion today and the Bill next month. They can choose their party or our children. I commend the motion to the House.</p>',\n",

A year later in September 2025, they will be able to access the full 30 hours for all eligible children aged nine months upwards.</p><p pid=\"d24.2/3\">We want parents to be able to access the new offer as soon as they can.

Once the roll-out is completed, eligible families will save up to &#163;6,500 per year. It will help parents to return to work or increase their hours, and tens of thousands of parents have already successfully applied for their codes, ready to take up their places in April.

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"d225.0/1\">It is a pleasure and a privilege to close today&#8217;s debate for the Opposition on what we hope will be the last King&#8217;s Speech from a Conservative Government for many years, because the general election cannot come soon enough and the British people should have the opportunity to have their say.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/2\">Opening the debate today, my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Angela Rayner\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25429\">the Member for Ashton-under-Lyne (Angela Rayner)</phrase> powerfully and movingly set out Labour&#8217;s case that this Government have let down our country and our people: our schools&#8212;crumbling; our skills system&#8212;broken; our housing market&#8212;failed. Our country cannot go on  like this. What we need is change, and the time for change is now. Crucially, the only party to deliver the change that we all need is today&#8217;s changed Labour party.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/3\">Today&#8217;s contributions from so many of my colleagues have spelled out the urgency of that change. We heard from many of my hon. and right hon. Friends on the challenges our country is facing right now and the actions a Labour Government would be taking on the side of working people. My right hon. Friends the Members for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms) and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell), and my hon. Friends the Members for Wallasey (Dame Angela Eagle), for Lewisham, Deptford (Vicky Foxcroft), for Oldham West and Royton (Jim McMahon), for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy), for Lewisham East (Janet Daby), for Batley and Spen (Kim Leadbeater), for Brentford and Isleworth (Ruth Cadbury), for Newport West (Ruth Jones), for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Emma Hardy) and for Preston (Sir Mark Hendrick) all set out very clearly the difference a Labour Government would make to our country.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/4\">One of the divides that such debates show so powerfully is between the core beliefs of our parties. Today it is distinctively Labour to believe that government can be and must be a force for good in people&#8217;s lives&#8212;not just administration but transformation, and not just keeping the show on the road but defining the road ahead&#8212;and only Labour understands that the purpose of government is to extend freedoms, to extend opportunities, for each of us and for all of us.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/5\">When we talk about opportunity, we mean that in its widest sense: educational opportunity for all of our children to be ready not just to live and work in our world but to understand and enjoy it. We want a country in which all our children, regardless of background, can achieve and thrive&#8212;economic opportunity, setting up our young people to achieve and succeed in the economy of today and tomorrow, with the chance not just to get by but to get on; social opportunity, so that families are not judged but supported, and so children and young people know that the future is for us all to shape together, not to face alone; cultural opportunity, to experience art, music, sport and drama, to get involved, to engage, to write, to participate, to pursue and to perform.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/6\">That is what we mean when we talk about opportunity: opportunity for each of us and for all of us. The change that Labour will bring is our determination to ensure that background is no barrier to opportunity, that excellence must be for everyone, and that high and rising standards for all our children and in all our schools are once again reality.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/7\">The speeches we heard yesterday from the Prime Minister and earlier from the Education Secretary were not about breaking down barriers to opportunity; they were missed opportunities. Let us think of all the issues that we might have heard about today. After all, the Department for Education&#8217;s own risk register, published back in the summer, lists six of them&#8212;six issues that the Government know they need to tackle, and on which they refuse to act. What of them? On industrial action, they have overseen some of the most sustained strikes in our schools for decades and have no plans to address the reasons for them. On education recovery after the pandemic, the Prime Minister said in his own words that he had &#8220;maxed out,&#8221; and the Education Secretary has given up.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/8\">On school building collapse, we heard not a word&#8212;although the Secretary of State has been keen to tell us that kids love nothing more than a Portakabin. On looked-after children, we heard not a word. On high-needs cost pressures on the special educational needs and disabilities and alternative provision system, we heard nothing at all. On cyber-security, we heard zero. On issue after issue, we have seen no evidence that the Government have learnt and no sign that they are ready. They are sleepwalking into disaster.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/9\">This goes far wider, as there are no plans for early years education; no plans to tackle the persistent absenteeism in our schools; no plans for a better and more effective school inspection and improvement system; no plans to tackle the growing problem of children who are missing altogether from our schools; no plans to deal with the exodus of qualified teachers from our schools and the growing crisis in recruitment; no plans for children&#8217;s social care or to tackle the crisis in provision facing children with special educational needs and disabilities; and no plans for fairer student finance. There is not a thing.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/10\">What did the Government give us in that very thin set of priorities? We got just a post-dated cheque on post-16 qualifications&#8212;a promise and no plan; an attack on our universities, on the young people who attend them, and on their hopes, dreams and aspirations. The Conservatives&#8217; determination is never clearer and never sharper than when they see the chance to kick at the ambitions of their favourite target: other people&#8217;s children. Of course, it would be easy to stand here and say that the answer is simply fiscal, but it is not just about levels of spending&#8212;it is also about choices and priorities.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/11\">We heard some imaginative and creative storytelling from the Secretary of State about Labour&#8217;s record in government, but I am very proud of what we achieved. I saw with my own eyes and experienced the difference that our record in power made in my community and for a generation of children. Millions of children were lifted out of poverty; and we had high standards in our schools, better supported teachers, Sure Start, the education maintenance allowance and Building Schools for the Future.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/12\">That is a record of which we are very proud, and the Government have nothing to speak to on this. Thirteen years ago, the share of total public expenditure on education and social protection relating to families was 16.3%, but by last year it had fallen to just 11.6%. There has been an almost 30% drop in the share of Government spending on the next generation. This is a story not of tough decisions for long-term change, but of Conservative Members making easy choices for short-term gain. For 13 long years, they have chipped away at opportunity, Budget after Budget, with law after law, chasing headlines, not tackling issues, and taking chances away from our children, ravaging the opportunities of a generation. I would say that the Government have balanced the books on the backs of our children, but they have not even managed that. Taxes on working people are at the highest level for almost 70 years and public sector net debt has risen to almost 98% of GDP. Theirs is a record of failure and of shame.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/13\">Labour&#8217;s focus on opportunity will start with our youngest children. The Government&#8217;s childcare entitlement expansion comes with no plan for delivery and no  workforce to make it happen. Labour is determined that childcare is more than work choices for parents&#8212;it is life chances for children. That is why we have asked Sir David Bell, the former chief inspector of Ofsted and former permanent secretary in the Department for Education, to lead our work on setting out the standards and workforce we need for the early education our children deserve. We need high and rising standards, right from the start. We need the best start to every education and every life. We will bring early language interventions&#8212;some of the best evidenced of all of our educational approaches&#8212;into settings and classrooms across our country. We will bring high and rising standards for all our children, into all our schools. We will bring breakfast clubs to every primary school, in every corner of our country. We are determined to tackle the huge surge in mental ill-health among our children, with mental health support in every secondary school and mental health hubs in every community. We will address the growing challenge of persistent absenteeism, which is now on track to mean 2 million children regularly missing school by 2025&#8212;that is one in four of our children.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/14\">That is because today there is no greater failing by this Government than standing by, as more and more children miss school for days on end, term after term. They are a lost generation, missing from England&#8217;s schools. High and rising standards mean children must be in school for the education they deserve. It means a reset of the relationship between families, schools and government. I pay tribute to the Children&#8217;s Commissioner for England, for whom the epidemic of student absence from our schools has rightly been a concern that she has pressed with the Government, and to Sky News, which has been relentless in pursuing the issue.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/15\">We will review the curriculum so it is fit for the age we live in and the future we need, filled with the knowledge our children need to achieve and thrive, woven through with the speaking, listening and digital skills that our children need to succeed&#8212;high and rising standards in every classroom and every school.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/16\">We will use the money raised from ending the tax breaks that private schools enjoy to invest in 6,500 more teachers. We will ensure all new teachers are qualified. We will drive change in how Ofsted reports on our schools, ending one-word summaries and empowering parents to be partners in the push for better. And we will deliver proper careers guidance and worthwhile work experience for all our children, in every school&#8212;high and rising standards, through every year of school, so our children are ready for work and ready for life.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/17\">We will reform the failed apprenticeships levy into a growth and skills levy. We will devolve skills budgets to combined authorities to bring decisions closer to our local communities and economies. We will bring in a new national body, Skills England, to drive the change we need to see across Government and beyond. And we will reform student finance to bring fairness to a system that punishes new graduates, young workers, those starting a family and those delivering our public services&#8212;high and rising standards for all our young people throughout their education and their lives.</p><p pid=\"d225.0/18\">By-election after by-election, from Tamworth to Rutherglen, from Selby to Mid Bedfordshire, makes it clear that Britain is longing for change. Speech after speech from Ministers tells us they are out of ideas, out  of ambition and out of time. The choice, whenever it comes, in the months ahead, will be a simple one. Today, it is clearer than ever that only Labour can bring the change Britain needs. I call upon Government Members to end the wait, to put country before party and to deliver a general election now.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"b132.0/1\">I congratulate the Chair of the Select Committee, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Robin Walker\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24862\">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Walker)</phrase>, on securing this important debate today and on the Committee&#8217;s excellent report on support for childcare in the early years. I am grateful to all hon. Members who have spoken in the debate, and I particularly congratulate my new hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Keir Mather\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/26271\">the Member for Selby and Ainsty (Keir Mather)</phrase> on a truly outstanding maiden speech. He has shown what a brilliant champion he will be for his constituents on the local, national and international issues that shape their lives. We are so glad to have him with us in this place.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/2\">I do not have time to mention specifically all the other contributions, but we have heard from hon. Members across the House about the eyewatering childcare costs that families face. We have heard about the deficit in Government funding for the so-called free hours. We have heard about the recruitment and retention problems faced by early years providers and about a sector that is under unbearable pressure.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/3\">Children&#8217;s earliest years are crucial to their development and life chances. Many of the factors that contribute to the education attainment gap are already present by the time children start school. Early years education and childcare should be focused on ensuring that families have the early support they need to give their child the best start in life and education, while also delivering affordable childcare to enable parents to work.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/4\">The current hours-based model for childcare funding is fundamentally not working for providers or for families. For families, it is inaccessible and complex and does not reflect the reality of their lives and working patterns, nor does it deliver affordability. At the same time, 4,800 providers were forced to close their doors last year due to rising costs. The current model is not working for them either.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/5\">Parents have seen rising costs year on year, and growing childcare deserts where they cannot access the childcare they need. There are now two children for  every Ofsted registered childcare place in England, creating a barrier to parents, particularly women, taking on employment. We are seeing women leaving the workforce for the first time in decades, priced out by the costs of childcare. It is parents of children with special educational needs and disabilities who find it hardest of all to find childcare places.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/6\">The Government have delivered a triple whammy&#8212;the most expensive childcare in Europe, an unviable financial model for providers and significant childcare deserts. It is a colossal failure for both families and the skilled professionals who work in early years. The policies that the Government have introduced in response to the crisis, after 13 years of failure and only because of intense pressure after the Chancellor spoke a year ago about the need to expand the labour market but mentioned the role of childcare only once, will not fix the problems. Additional funding is welcome, but pumping it into a system that is already broken will not deliver the change families need.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/7\">Childcare providers are clear that, as things stand, they cannot deliver the expanded entitlement. A survey of 800 providers by the Early Years Alliance found that only 20% of providers who currently offer places to two-year-olds plan to deliver additional places under the expanded entitlement. Another 33% said that they were unsure whether they would deliver places under the new scheme. That is because the Government have no plan for expanding the workforce to deliver an expanded entitlement in a sector already struggling to recruit and retain staff, no plan for premises for which there are rightly strict requirements in the early years sector, and no vision for quality in the early years.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/8\">Childcare must be about more than just minding children while their parents work. It should be able to provide every child with high-quality early years education. A Labour Government will be driven by our mission to break down the barriers to opportunity at every stage, including by boosting child development with 500,000 more children hitting the early learning goals by 2030. Labour is determined that childcare should offer more flexibility, better availability and high standards for children and families. We will draw on the best practice internationally to drive an ambitious and coherent programme of reform, with higher standards for early education, better availability, stronger regulation of the financial sustainability of providers and a clear strategy for the childcare workforce. We have commissioned former Ofsted chief inspector Sir David Bell to undertake a full review of the early years sector and help to develop the detail of our early years plan.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/9\">A Labour Government will work with the early years sector to build capacity, including by removing the legislative barriers to local authorities opening new provision. We will also work with the sector to ensure that there is a plan for the early years workforce that offers more opportunities through high quality training and recognition for the skilled work of early years practitioners. We will also recognise that childcare does not end when children start school. We will deliver funded breakfast clubs in every primary school to help parents work, provide opportunities for children to play, learn and socialise at the start of the school day and ensure that every child is able to access a healthy, nutritious breakfast and start the school day ready to learn.</p><p pid=\"b132.0/10\">The Government&#8217;s record is the most expensive childcare in Europe, childcare providers closing their doors and childcare deserts across the country. They have always regarded children as an afterthought, and in doing so they have failed children and their families. After 13 years, their sticking-plaster solutions will not fix things now. A Labour Government will deliver a childcare system that works for children and their families from the end of parental leave to the end of primary school. We put children at the heart of our programme of government from 1997 to 2010, and we will do so again.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"d1028.0/1\">The worst health emergency for 100 years and the worst energy price shock for 50 years have done severe damage to our economy in the last few years, but the Budget has demonstrated the positive impact of the difficult decisions taken in the autumn statement to repair the public finances and restore stability after the damage done by global economic turmoil. As we have heard, unemployment is near a 50-year low, productivity is higher now than it was before the pandemic, and the OBR predicts that we will not go into recession, that inflation will fall and that growth is returning. That means we are on track to meet the first three of the Prime Minister&#8217;s five priorities, which are to halve inflation, grow the economy, reduce debt, cut NHS waiting times and stop the boats.</p><p pid=\"d1028.0/2\">At the heart of the Budget and the Government&#8217;s wider economic policy is helping people with cost of living pressures. Taken together, the measures in the Budget and those previously announced are worth &#163;94 billion over this year and next&#8212;one of the largest support packages in Europe&#8212;which is an average of more than &#163;3,300 for every household in the country. In advance of his statement, I asked the Chancellor for the continuation of Government support for energy bills. I also made the case for families struggling with childcare costs, raising the issue alongside others in Parliament just a week or two ago, so I am really pleased with the plan to extend the 30 hours of free childcare for working parents to cover children from the age of nine months to four years. It is also very welcome that the childcare component of universal credit can now be paid up front.</p><p pid=\"d1028.0/3\">This package is a truly radical set of changes, and investing in early years education and childcare is a sound economic move. Not only will it bring more parents back into the workplace to help address labour shortages; high-quality early years provision can also be an engine of social mobility, helping children to get the best start in life in order to enable them to realise their potential and succeed in their aspirations. The increase in the rates to be paid to childcare settings for delivering the free entitlement is a crucial part of this endeavour. It has been a key ask of the sector, but what is now proposed is still a very big change and implementation will not be easy, so I will be scrutinising progress carefully as a member of both the all-party parliamentary group for nursery schools, nursery and reception classes, and the APPG on childcare and early education.</p><p pid=\"d1028.0/4\">I welcome the changes to the pension tax rules, which have been pushing experienced GPs and hospital doctors to cut their hours and retire early, just when we need them most. I have raised that problem with successive Health Secretaries and Chancellors of the Exchequer. The lifetime allowance is, I am afraid, a classic example of where taxes get so high that they deter work and depress economic activity. It is not just about the very  high taxes paid if a person hits the lifetime allowance limit; it is also about the uncertainty, which means that doctors have cut their hours even if they have not hit the limit, because they fear reaching it. Both are causing problems with the retention of our hard-working doctors, so I believe that the changes announced by the Chancellor yesterday will play an important part in reducing those NHS waiting times in the way that we all want. I hope that it will also mean that my constituents have faster and better access to GP appointments.</p><p pid=\"d1028.0/5\">Finally, I want to highlight some areas where further action is needed in relation to Budget matters. Implementation of reforms relating to the regulatory climate for artificial intelligence and the approval of medicines, as announced yesterday, are welcome, but I would like to see a more concerted push to improve regulation to make it more targeted and more agile and to ensure that it keeps up with technological change. This area can play a crucial role in raising productivity, boosting growth and making this country the science super-power that the Prime Minister wants it to be. It is also crucial to raising living standards in the long term.</p><p pid=\"d1028.0/6\">The taskforce on innovation, growth and regulatory reform set out a blueprint for starting this reform process, and I would ask the Minister to report back on progress in implementation of the taskforce&#8217;s recommendations. I welcome the indication by the Chancellor that he will come back with a plan for one of TIGRR&#8217;s key proposals &#8212;to unlock productive investment from pension funds&#8212;but we do need to get on with this. The freedom to make our own choices on regulation and design these rules according to our own national interest is a key benefit from Brexit, and we need to grab the opportunity that it presents.</p><p pid=\"d1028.0/7\">Lastly, I fully back, of course, the caution shown in this Budget on the public finances. Bearing down on inflation and getting debt under control must be our top priority. But as the economic situation, I hope, continues to improve, I would ask my right hon. Friend the Chancellor to strive to find the room for further pay increases for the public sector and, of course, for wider tax reductions in the longer term.</p>',\n",

However, my right hon. Friend the Member for Chelmsford has reported that the UN special rapporteur on violence against women and girls has described it as world- leading. Many other countries are following our progress, and, indeed, may adopt similar legislation. The Bill will tackle criminal activity online. It will protect children from harmful and inappropriate content, and it aims to stop the rise of online misogyny. Several Members have mentioned the importance of that.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/3\">Let me say something about business. The UK is now successfully including gender provision in all the free trade agreements that we have made since leaving the EU. Our trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, for instance, contain dedicated trade and gender equality chapters. That too is groundbreaking work. As for our domestic business focus, our taskforce on women-led high- growth enterprise was established last summer. I want to pay tribute to my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Flick Drummond\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25392\">the Member for Meon Valley (Mrs Drummond)</phrase> for her work in the all-party parliamentary group on women and work, not just her work in pushing science, technology, engineering and maths for women, but the high-growth sector work she is doing. If we deliver more women with ambition, we will improve growth in our economy and also improve the outcome for those women as they thrive in the workplace.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/4\">We know that childcare is an issue. That is why we have spent more than &#163;3.5 billion over the last three years on early education entitlement, and have increased the funding for local authorities to &#163;160 million this year, &#163;180 million next year and &#163;170 million thereafter, to allow them to increase their payments to local childcare providers. I recognise the challenges and the cost that childcare imposes on families, but I also know how difficult it is for the providers to sustain their business model.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/5\">Turning briefly to women&#8217;s health, I am proud that in the past year we have published the first women&#8217;s health strategy for England. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Florence Eshalomi\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25759\">The hon. Member for Vauxhall  (Florence Eshalomi)</phrase> mentioned that in particular, and I am very keen that we make progress in that space, especially on maternity disparities. We have appointed Dame Lesley Regan as the first women&#8217;s health ambassador to lead that work. We announced yesterday that we are investing &#163;25 million to roll out women&#8217;s health hubs across the country, providing a one-stop shop for women&#8217;s healthcare needs.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/6\">We will also level up IVF access to same-sex couples and across the board, ensuring consistent provision across the country, which does not currently exist. The HRT prepayment certificate will be launched from <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 April</phrase>, cutting the cost of HRT by hundreds of pounds. We also aim to announce our pregnancy loss certificate later this summer, so that babies born before 24 weeks can be registered&#8212;an important issue for those parents who have lost babies. The major conditions strategy will look at long-term conditions such as heart disease, musculoskeletal conditions and dementia, the leading cause of death in women, which for too long have been ignored.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/7\">Finally, I want to touch on girls&#8217; education, which it is a top priority for us in both our international commitment&#8212;we want 12 years of quality education for every girl, which is the best way to get girls and women out of poverty&#8212;and our domestic commitments. The Prime Minister in his first speech set out his ambition to ensure that all school pupils in England study some form of maths to the age of 18. My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jackie Doyle-Price\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24957\">the Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price)</phrase> raised the issue of teaching materials in schools; the Prime Minister yesterday committed to a review of those and we will look forward to what that shows.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/8\">We need to get more women and girls into science, because, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Basingstoke said, despite getting more girls into STEM   A-levels and on to undergraduate courses, we only see women making up 29.4% of the STEM workforce. That is why we are running our STEM Returners pilot; there are 75,000 people, mainly women, with experience and qualifications in STEM who are not working in the sector and who we want to see return to practice.</p><p pid=\"b478.5/9\">I hope that that showcases some of the work we are doing across the board. There are many challenges&#8212;we do not deny or shirk that fact&#8212;but we are making significant progress. In particular, domestically, on violence against women and girls, I hope that this time next year we will have a better story to tell.</p>',\n",

He is right about the importance of early years, about which he cares deeply. He talked about the amount that childcare entitlements have increased under successive Conservative Governments, and he gave a balanced speech on the challenges we face, the dividends from getting this right and the power of early identification, about which I am passionate. I commend his ongoing work as Chair of the Education Committee, and I look forward to his report.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/3\">I thank my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrea Leadsom\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24829\">the Member for South Northamptonshire (Dame Andrea Leadsom)</phrase> for her focus and leadership on early years and best start for life. I remember working with her on the &#163;500 million support package in 2019. Before this job, when I was writing a report on supporting parents, she was one of the most helpful, impressive and insightful people I spoke to. I am glad the House got to hear some of her insights today, as graphic as they might have been. There is more, if people would like to discuss it further.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/4\">My right hon. Friend is a brilliant champion for this area, particularly in her tremendous work on family hubs. I remember working on family hubs more than 10 years ago, when I was at the Centre for Social Justice, and she brought them to life. I am pleased that they will be in half of local authorities, providing excellent support on, for example, breastfeeding. When I talk to those in places such as A Better Start Southend, they tell me that the effect of breastfeeding support can be transformational in the number of people it can help. It is incredibly effective.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/5\">My right hon. Friend mentioned the importance of dads, and she also mentioned the importance of childminders and one-to-one care. My hon.

I have been to see an Ofsted inspection, and I can talk about the great outcomes that childminders achieve and the wonderful work they do.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/6\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Munira Wilson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25820\">The hon. Member for Twickenham (Munira Wilson)</phrase> talked about a variety of things, including funding for single parents. I was pleased to table a private Member&#8217;s Bill on child maintenance, which my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud has brilliantly taken through the House. This is really important for single parents.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/7\">There is more we can do on the complexity of tax-free childcare, and we had an increase in tax-free childcare referrals following our campaign last year on childcare choices. The increases in recent times have been quite large, with a 116% increase in referrals, but there is more to be done.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/8\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa Villiers\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/11500\">the Member for Chipping Barnet (Theresa Villiers)</phrase> ably raised the plight of children who face troubling challenges in their early years. We spend &#163;10.8 billion on children&#8217;s services, and we have set out some transformational work, particularly on early help. I met Ruby, a social worker in Leeds, who is supporting a young lady through her pregnancy as she prepares for birth, and she told me how important that support will be to a successful start. My right hon. Friend has been a longstanding campaigner for maintained nursery schools, and we are investing &#163;10 million in 2023-24. I pay huge tribute to her work in that area.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/9\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Fleur Anderson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25813\">The hon. Member for Putney (Fleur Anderson)</phrase> misrepresented the OECD statistics, but she talked about the importance of getting speech and language right in early years, and I absolutely agree. We are making sure that we have enough special educational needs co-ordinators in early years, and we are looking at particular pathways, on which we are working with the NHS, as part of our change programme for the special educational needs package for early language and support. We are also setting out best practice guidance on early language and support, which is crucial.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/10\">My hon. Friend the Member for Stroud has been a complete champ on childcare, families and relationships, not least by producing two children in her time in Parliament, which is mind-boggling. She is brilliant in her thoughtful campaigning on childminders, childminder agencies&#8212;she mentioned how good they are&#8212;training and apprenticeships, and so much else. She might like to know that I am meeting Koru Kids on Monday.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/11\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jon Trickett\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10604\">The hon. Member for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett)</phrase> is the only man from any Opposition party to speak in this debate, for which I commend him. He might want to champion that childcare is not a women&#8217;s issue.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/12\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Simmonds\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25892\">the Member for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (David Simmonds)</phrase> mentioned the dedicated schools grant&#8212;I have looked into that, and I would be delighted to speak to him further&#8212;the disability access fund and the differences between local authorities. We know that, for example, some can take four to six weeks to get through their checks of a childminder whereas others can take six months; there are a variety out there, but some are doing really well and we need to look at how we spread that best practice.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/13\">I want to take this opportunity to put on record my thanks to all those who are working in education settings, providing ongoing support for children, young people and all learners. Some 96% of our providers on the  early years register are good or outstanding, which I believe is up from 74% in 2012. I am grateful today for the opportunity to discuss early years and childcare. Let me set out the overall funding picture, an issue that has been raised multiple times today because of the nature of the debate. For 2022-23, the Department for Education&#8217;s resource budget is about &#163;77 billion. The change since the beginning of the financial year relates primarily to accounting movements in the fair value of the student loan book, itself driven by changes in macroeconomic factors.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/14\">The evidence on early years and childcare has been mentioned today, and it is clear: high-quality early education supports children&#8217;s development and prepares younger children for school. Access to high-quality childcare helps children to learn in their earliest years and supports a functioning economy by enabling parents to work. Our 15 hours&#8217; free early education entitlement for all three and four-year-olds has been supporting children&#8217;s development and helping prepare them for school. We remain committed to the continuation of this universal offer of 15 hours&#8217; free early education, helping more than 1 million children this year to get on in school.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/15\">We are also committed to making childcare more affordable and accessible for working parents, with the 30 hours&#8217; free childcare entitlement. It is one of our key areas of Government support for families, helping to save those eligible about &#163;6,000 a year. Nearly 350,000 children were registered for a place in January 2022, and our 2021 childcare and early years parents survey found that almost three quarters of parents reported having more money to spend since they started using the 30 hours, and almost two in five thought that without the entitlement they would be working fewer hours.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/16\">Government support for childcare is not just limited to three and four-year-olds. In 2013, we introduced 15 hours&#8217; free childcare for disadvantaged two-year-olds; in January 2022, 72% of eligible two-year-olds were registered for a free early education place, and more than 1.2 million children have benefited since its introduction. Following a consultation, we extended eligibility for this entitlement to children in no recourse to public fund households in September 2022, enabling even more children to benefit.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/17\">This Government have invested heavily in the early years, giving our children the best start in life. Some &#163;3.5 billion has been spent in each of the past three years on our early education entitlements alone for two to four-year-old children. I know the sector is facing economic challenges, similar to those being faced across the country. We have already announced additional funding of &#163;160 million in 2022-23, &#163;180 million in 2023-24 and &#163;170 million in 2024-25, compared with the figure for the 2021-22 financial year, for local authorities to increase the hourly rates they pay to childcare providers. In December, we announced that for 2023-24 we will invest an additional &#163;20 million in early years entitlements funding, on top of that additional &#163;180 million I have just mentioned. Taken together, this will help to support early years providers. In addition, we have been supporting them on energy bills and with a &#163;180 million package of support on educational recovery, covering off some of that SEND work that I just talked about.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/18\">We have also been rolling out family hubs, with a &#163;300 million package. We have a &#163;200 million programme, the holiday activities fund, which is absolutely brilliant and really targets disadvantaged children. When we carried out the first survey of the cohort coming through, we found that about 70% of children said that they had not been on anything like that before. We have &#163;28 million of support for early language in particular, and &#163;560 million is going on youth services. We have the start for life programme, as well as the early language speech pathways with the NHS that I mentioned and all the work we are doing on that.</p><p pid=\"b375.0/19\">I am happy to assure the House that improving the cost, choice and availability of childcare for working parents and making sure that providers are well supported are enormously important to me, and we will not ignore the cost pressures faced by the sector in the cost of living crisis. We will continue to explore all options.</p>',\n",

It is not something that I have looked at, but I understand that there are already examples in legislation and I heard the challenge to the Minister to look carefully at this. It is important. We cannot create legislation in the knowledge that people are going to get let off the hook or that they will learn how to respond when pulled up by the police. That is why we have to be clear about the balance and about what the Bill does and does not do. We have to think through a range of different examples and about the responses that will be given by the perpetrators, so that the legislation is tight.</p><p pid=\"d648.0/2\">As the shadow Minister, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alex Cunningham\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24742\">the hon. Member for Stockton North (Alex Cunningham)</phrase>, made clear, we have to avoid demonising all men and boys. They are not all bad. They are not all plonkers. We know that men and boys are very much part of the solution. Early education in our schools is absolutely vital, but we cannot get away from the fact that the incidents are generally perpetrated by men. It is right to continue that debate and to also be really careful with our language about men and boys.</p><p pid=\"d648.0/3\">To conclude, the reality is that only 26% of those who experience public sexual harassment report the incident to the police, no matter how scared, harassed or intimidated they have been by it. We have also heard examples such as that robustly and passionately given by my right hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton North of the girl in the supermarket. That was a really visual story of the nonsense that girls and women have to go through every single day when they are not asking for it or wearing anything provocative but just trying to do their job. With such examples in our minds and this happening every single day of the week, of the month, of the year, we have to make changes.</p><p pid=\"d648.0/4\">I am relieved and really grateful that the next time I am in Stroud with Stroud High School girls or with the campaign group This Ends Now and other teams, or the next time I am on a march or dealing with these issues in front of a group of people in our town hall, I will be able to point to the Government backing this Bill as yet another example of the Government wanting to protect women and girls and being prepared to create the legislation to do so and bring our laws up to date.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a1261.1/1\">Let me say again, as I have already this week, how much admiration I have for Madam Deputy Speaker, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Eleanor Laing\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10348\">the right hon. Member for Epping Forest (Dame Eleanor Laing)</phrase>, and the other Madam Deputy Speaker, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Rosie Winterton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10648\">the right hon. Member for Doncaster Central (Dame Rosie Winterton)</phrase>. They are both marvellous, inspiring, incredibly stylish women. Parliament, and the parliamentary hairdressers, will be all the poorer for their departure. I wish them both well in the future, and I am sure that we will see them again.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/2\">It is my pleasure to wind up this valedictory debate, at 6.44 pm on a Friday; I do not intend to make a habit of speaking in Parliament so late on a Friday. We have had 31 speeches today, all of which have been incredibly moving, powerful and emotional. As the main Labour person in the Chamber for the past four and a half hours, I have felt slightly like a gate-crasher at a private party, but I am glad to have been here. Today has shown that all of us in politics know that this is a vocation, not a job. It is a life in service, always in the public eye, and very rarely with an off switch. We have been reminded today, as we often are, that the constituents are the boss, and our families are the bedrock.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/3\">A huge amount of parliamentary experience is leaving this place today. I could not even add up the collective number of years of service by everybody who has spoken today. It is a huge amount, and we should recognise that for what it is. While I personally am excited for the general election, I have felt a great deal of sadness today and this week for so many people departing. I have felt today how many of my friends on the Government Benches are leaving. It has been a very emotional day for all of us. These really are the very best days in Parliament. I am sure that we can all agree on that. It has felt a little bit like the last day at high school, which today is for lots of year 11s and year 13s across the country. Perhaps we can all swap shirts at the end of the debate and sign them for each other. [Interruption.] Okay, well, we could all sign each other&#8217;s shirts&#8212;you know what I mean!</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/4\">One of the themes of contributions today is the importance of cross-party working, so I will try to respond in that spirit. How fitting it was that the two opening speeches were from such long-standing, powerful women Members of Parliament. This has been very different from many valedictory debates that we have had in years gone by. Those two women, who I will come on to say something about, inspired many of the other women who spoke today. That was a real theme of the debate.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/5\">My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Harriet Harman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10260\">the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase> sends her apologies: she cannot be here for the wind-ups, and wants it noted that she had a bit of an accident with an out-of-control buggy when she was on granny duty. She is fit and strong, but she had to leave to get more painkillers for her shoulders. She really has been an exemplary Member of Parliament&#8212;the Mother of the House, and political mother to many of us. She really did create a path for many of us to follow.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/6\">It was also a real privilege to be here for the last speech by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa May\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10426\">the right hon.

He was only matched by the Member who followed him, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matthew Offord\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24955\">the hon. Member for Hendon (Dr Offord)</phrase>, who spoke very well about the importance of the different communities we all have in our constituencies.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/33\">In summing up, I want to say a couple of other things. One Member is not here but, during our debate, he announced that he would be standing down: <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Craig Mackinlay\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25437\">the hon.

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a999.0/1\">I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Helen Morgan\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/26056\">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Helen Morgan)</phrase> for instigating this debate. I am only sad not to see <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> in his place&#8212;this may be the final Adjournment debate of the Session, and I feel personally hurt that he has not been here to intervene and to give Strangford&#8217;s take on Shropshire. However, I am sure he is somewhere thinking of us and kicking himself that he is not here.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/2\">The hon. Member for North Shropshire was right to say that all politics is local. She is also right to echo something that I have said on many occasions: most people&#8217;s exposure in our communities is to the facilities and services provided by local councils for their communities. We agree absolutely on that. I want to place on the record my thanks to all the councillors and officers of Shropshire Council, and indeed to local government across the country, for all that they do and strive to do. They get out of bed in the morning to achieve for their communities, to deliver change, to make place and to improve opportunities and living.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/3\">The hon. Lady referred specifically to libraries. Libraries is a topic very close to my heart, both as a keen reader and, as a child, an avid attender of our local library. Dorset Council has done the most phenomenal work with its libraries in similarly challenging circumstances, being a rural council and the like. I am pretty certain that should her officers in Shropshire reach out to those in Dorset, they would be happy to provide some advice or guidance&#8212;call it what you will&#8212;on safeguarding the future delivery of those important services.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/4\">The hon. Lady is right that I have acknowledged&#8212;the Government have acknowledged&#8212;the challenging financial circumstances of local government, brought about in whole, or certainly in very great part, by pressures on adult social care, special educational needs and disabilities, and home-to-school transport. Around about 80% of an upper-tier council&#8217;s budget is spent on 10% to 15% of its population. We just have to watch that balance to ensure that council tax payers feel that they are getting something for their money. As she will know, I have not  committed on behalf of the Government to a root-and-branch review of the local government funding formula, because my assessment is that it is all but broken&#8212;an analogue proposal for a digital age that needs reworking from the bottom up. I have always asked for certainty and clarity from the local government sector, and as a Government, we have always been keen to deliver them. In the next Parliament, they could best be delivered by having, in the short term, a multi-year settlement to give that security, and then by Parliament using that time&#8212;and I cannot overstate the value that I see in this&#8212;to provide a cross-party sustainable solution for delivering on these issues.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/5\">I do not say this flippantly, because I have thought about it, but the hon. Lady has spoken in this Chamber and in Westminster Hall about local government finance and local government issues more generally, and I have answered on many occasions her questions and those of Labour Members, and it suddenly struck me early this morning&#8212;I do not know why it struck me then&#8212;that although they may identify a problem, I have yet to hear their solution. I have yet to hear the genesis of an idea from the Opposition parties. The Labour party has had 14 years to think about it, and the hon. Lady&#8217;s party has had the past nine years, but there is absolutely no idea. She told us&#8212;I jotted down her words contemporaneously &#8212;that we need to give consideration to</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a999.0/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;how we fund social care, and indeed how we collect council tax.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a999.0/7\">I agree with her, but she gave no suggested solution to those pressing problems. I find that very strange given that Opposition parties really have nothing else to do than beaver away on policy to put before the electorate in just a few weeks&#8217; time.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/8\">Although the hon. Lady was right to point out that she has no idea, and no more do I, of what the result of the election will be, it is very much my hope that I may be standing at the Government Dispatch Box setting out the plans to which we have committed on the fundamental review and rewriting of local government finance. I shall leave that to the electorate of North Dorset to decide, and I hope that they put their faith and trust in me, as they have done on the past several occasions.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/9\">Let me turn briefly to some of the figures. I have said them so many times now that I get slightly bored of them, but I think it worthwhile to read them into the record. The local government finance settlement for 2024-25 makes available up to &#163;64.7 billion&#8212;an increase in core spending power of up to &#163;4.5 billion, or 7.5% in cash terms, compared with 2023-24. We listened to the views of local government, and many colleagues from across the House, including the hon. Lady, who knows how grateful I was that she took part in the parliamentary level of the consultation that I undertook, which was the highest level of take-up that a Minister has delivered. As a result of listening to what we heard, the Government announced additional measures for local authorities in England worth a further &#163;600 million, including &#163;500 million of new funding for councils with responsibility for adult and children&#8217;s social care.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/10\">What does that represent as far as the hon. Lady&#8217;s council is concerned? The settlement represents an increase in core spending power of up to &#163;25.1 million, or 8%, making available a whopping total of &#163;340.2 million in 2024-25. That is not small beer for Shropshire Council. I also recognise, as the hon. Lady does, the additional  cost pressures and challenges of delivering quality services in a rural environment with a sparse population and longer travel times, which is why we have set such enormous store by the rural services delivery grant. As she knows, because Shropshire ranks within the top 25 sparsely populated areas in England, her council received an additional &#163;9 million through the RSDG for 2024-25 on top of the other moneys I have spoken of, in order to assist with the importance and the difficulties of serving dispersed populations.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/11\">Is it enough&#8212;is it ever enough? Who knows? We always need more. It is important that every year, councils take the opportunity to learn from others, peer review, and engage the Local Government Association to help them modernise and seek savings through shared services and other initiatives. I know that many councils do that, but not all do. As we know, Shropshire went unitary and gleaned a huge amount of financial benefit from so doing, as did my council area of Dorset. There are things that local authorities can be doing to reduce expenditure and to use the money from the savings they make to continue to deliver those services that, increasingly, people look to their local council to deliver.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/12\">In conclusion, I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Shropshire for raising this issue. She and I share many things, including a concern for making sure that our rural areas are well represented in this place. I will continue to do that on behalf of my constituents; I hope the hon. Lady will not take it ill if I say that I hope my party will represent North Shropshire after the general election, but it has been a personal pleasure to work alongside her over these past several months since I have been dealing with local government. She has brought a lot of engagement to the process. I am just sorry that her party has not brought forward any ideas, but let us share those ideas cross-party in the next Parliament to ensure we have a robust settlement rubric that will meet demands: one that will be cost-effective and affordable, but will continue to deliver the quality of public services that so many in our communities rely upon and rightly deserve.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/13\">Question put and agreed to.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/14\">House adjourned.</p>',\n",

I hope they will look with kindness on what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Minister, although there are other interpretations in respect of a number of issues.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/3\">Those who think there should be a memorial do not necessarily think the learning centre should be with it, while those who think there should be a learning centre do not think it should be squashed into what I described as a box under a memorial. There are many who think that the memorial could be better than the design that was not chosen in Ottawa, and I think it is a continuing embarrassment to the Government that the name of the person who was mentioned 13 times in the announcement of the winning design, Sir David Adjaye, is one that Ministers cannot say today.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/4\">I refer Members to the transcript of the Select Committee hearing on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">5 February</phrase>. Let me quote from paragraph 25:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Many people will know Sir David Adjaye&#8217;s statement that &#8216;disrupting the pleasure of being in a park is key to the thinking&#8217;, but fewer people have heard the first part of that quote which is, &#8216;We have the opportunity to activate the entire site&#8217;&#8221;,</p><p pid=\"a984.1/6\">or what he had said previously:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;&#8216;There has been a kind of picture painted that this is a public garden...It moves from being just a kind of public park to being much more ceremonial, much more kind of ordered&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/8\">I could also quote from paragraphs 26 and 27, but I will not do so.

That is by 31%, not about 15% as noticed and remarked on by the inspector, or 10% in the figures given by Baroness Scott&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/10\">&#8212;the Minister in the House of Lords&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;in her 2023 parliamentary answer, or even zero reduction, as stated by David Adjaye, misleadingly&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/12\">&#8212;I would say &#8220;mistakenly&#8221;&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;to the inquiry. A 31% loss cannot possibly be said to be an enhancement or a reconfiguration of the playground. That is what Chris Pincher, then briefly Minister of State, said in support of his 2021 planning permission approval for this project.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/14\">I refer Members to a book by Dorian Gerhold, &#8220;Victoria Tower Gardens&#8221;, which is subtitled &#8220;The prehistory, creation and planned destruction of a London park&#8221;. What we are talking about here is not particularly the memorial&#8212;having a good memorial would be better than having a bad memorial&#8212;but Victoria Tower Gardens. We have this legislation because the Government did not care about the 1900 Act.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/15\">I say to the Government that better faith would have been acknowledging that the Bill they were putting forward was hybrid, without resisting that fact to the examiners in both Houses. We now pass the Bill on the  House of Lords, where I believe that people will look again, with fresh eyes and fair eyes, at how we can commemorate those who died but do the best we can to educate people so that what happened is less likely to happen again.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/16\">The idea that a particular memorial will stop it happening would be laughed at by those who are commemorating and mourning the Yazidi genocide 10 years ago, the Rwandan genocide, and one or two others I could name in other parts of the world. We have to do what is right.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/17\">Let me end by saying this. My first cousin once removed was one of the Westminster Medical School students who went into Bergen-Belsen and were able to saves the lives of about half the people who were existing there at the time. I have worked with people Holocaust survivors, and I believe that we do best by doing what is right in a good way, which is why I welcome what <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matthew Pennycook\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25379\">the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook)</phrase> said about the normal planning process. As my right hon. Friend the Minister said and as Christopher Katkowski has said, the normal planning process will happen.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/18\">Let us look forward&#8212;if the Bill is carried over&#8212;to a planning process in which an application is made to the local authority, and the local authority makes the decision. If the authority approves the application, there is no problem; if it does not, the Minister can call it in, but the Minister should not call it in before Westminster City Council has had a chance to see any revised proposals that the Government can now put forward.</p>',\n",

Friend is right, and most people will agree with him, even if their job is to stand up and say something different.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/2\">I will not spend much time on the planning permission, because it is not the subject of the Bill. When the inspector&#8217;s report was received by the Government and considered, this was the conclusion under the signature of the planning casework unit:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/3\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;This decision was made by the Minister of State for Housing in line with the published handling arrangements for this case&#8230;and signed on his behalf. In particular, those handling arrangements state that:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8216;Christopher Pincher MP (the Housing and Planning Minister) will be responsible for exercising the functions of the Secretary of State under sections 70 and 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act&#8217;&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a938.1/5\">and so on. Who here believes that a Minister of State would, on merit, turn down an application by their own Secretary of State? I will give way to anybody who wants to make that suggestion. It is just incredible. It would not happen.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/6\">I will now change tone a bit. During the Select Committee hearings, the Government counsel suddenly switched from saying who the lead designer and architect for the proposal was. The Government&#8217;s press notice announcing the winner contained 13 references to Sir David Adjaye, now Order of Merit, four references to Ron Arad, and no references to Asa Bruno. Proper tribute  has been paid to Asa Bruno. It is true that he was the one who put a number of points to the inspector. He is recognised as a leading designer, and his obituary, which I refreshed my mind on just now, showed that he was a startlingly good person. However, when the Government announced the lead designer and architect for the proposal, they named Sir David Adjaye, who could hardly be mentioned by the promoters at the Select Committee for reasons that I will not go into now. They are well known and in the public domain.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/7\">Let us turn to the points that the Government made to the Select Committee after I raised that issue:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">24 January</phrase>, in a debate on the Business of the House (col 439), Sir Peter Bottomley MP referred to the proceedings at the seventh public session of the Holocaust Memorial Bill committee and suggested that counsel for the Promoter may have &#8216;inadvertently told the committee things that are contradicted by the facts&#8230;&#8217; in relation to responsibilities for the design of the Memorial.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a938.1/9\">I was then told that what was said was right. I think that that leading counsel, over and over again, was trying to write Sir David Adjaye out because of the embarrassment to Government. If it was Asa Bruno who was responsible for the Ottawa proposal, so be it, but that was not what Government said seven years ago in public.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/10\">I am going to go on fighting this, but not so long this evening, because my colleagues have more to say. I say to those watching the proceedings, &#8220;Look into the details of what has happened.&#8221; I commend to them early-day motions 711, tabled on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 May</phrase>, and 775, tabled on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">21 May</phrase>.

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a849.3/1\">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to talk about awareness and understanding, and the role of communication in that. I will speak a little more about communication, but there is always more that we will need to do. Of course, I would also be happy to continue the conversation with her about how best we do it.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/2\">The guidance makes it clear that schools should ensure that they are aware of any pupils with allergies, and should have processes in place to ensure that the allergies can be well managed. Practices to identify children with such needs could include wristbands, or, as my hon. Friend said, having a photograph of the child alongside details of their allergy in the kitchen or serving area of the school. I stress again that individual schools are best placed to work with parents to put in place the most effective responsive system.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/3\">In addition to the section 100 duty, schools are subject to other requirements. In the UK, food businesses must inform consumers if they use any of the 14 mandatory allergens as ingredients in their food. How allergen  information should be provided depends on whether the food is prepacked, non-prepacked or prepacked for direct sale. This includes food provided by institutions such as school caterers, who have a responsibility to protect the people in their care. As colleagues may know, rules on the provision of food labelling are set out primarily in the retained 2014 regulations, and these include a requirement to identify the presence of any of those 14 mandatory allergens to consumers.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/4\">The Department for Education also works closely with the Food Standards Agency, which provides free food allergy and intolerance training online. This offers practical advice to local authority law enforcement officers and anyone wanting to learn more about food allergies, such as those working in the food manufacturing and catering industries. The FSA also offers a whole host of other training, technical documents and guidance.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/5\">Turning to auto-injectors, these can be vital when a child is suffering an allergic reaction. To support schools in meeting the needs of children with allergies, the Government passed the Human Medicines (Amendment) Regulations 2017, which allow schools to obtain and hold spare adrenaline auto-injectors for administration to pupils in an emergency. The Department for Health and Social Care has produced guidance on the use of adrenaline auto-injectors and emergency inhalers in schools, including the purchase of spares. The guidance makes it clear that any adrenalin auto-injectors held by a school should be considered a back-up device, rather than a replacement for a pupil&#8217;s own adrenalin auto-injector.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/6\">Beyond this, families have a vital role to play in managing their child&#8217;s condition. We are very clear with schools that no one will know a child&#8217;s needs as well as their parents, and that schools should work closely with parents. The parents of children with allergies will work with medical professionals and other organisations to plan for and navigate their child&#8217;s specific needs. Parents should be fully consulted and engaged in any discussions relating to their child&#8217;s allergy.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/7\">Schools will also need to ensure that the parents or carers of children with food allergies or intolerances are given information about the allergenic ingredients used in the foods available. Good communication between parents and schools on allergies and pupils&#8217; needs is essential to keep children safe while in school.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/8\">My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton referred to the role of Ofsted, further to the points made by the hon. Member for Strangford, and the importance of schools having a clear allergies policy and involving parents in discussions about the needs of their children. Ofsted inspectors gather a wide range of evidence to make their judgments, and evaluate the experience of individuals or groups of individuals, which can include the experiences of pupils with medical needs, if the issue is raised by parents or pupils. In an inspection, inspectors will assess the effectiveness of safeguarding at the school, which includes the extent to which pupils with specific needs and vulnerabilities are kept safe. The safeguarding culture is also explored by speaking to leaders and staff about their work and the messages that pupils receive through the curriculum.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/9\">During last November&#8217;s Westminster Hall debate on pupils with allergies, my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton informed the House that she would write to all schools in her constituency to ask them to adopt the voluntary schools allergy code, co-created by  the Benedict Blythe Foundation, the Independent Schools Bursars Association and the allergy team. Taking her lead, Ministers in the Department for Education instructed officials to share a link to the code in our fortnightly email bulletin to schools issued on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 March</phrase>. That communication also reminded school leaders of their duties concerning pupils with allergies.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/10\">For younger children, the early years foundation stage framework sets the standards that all registered early years providers must meet for the learning, development and care of children from birth to age five. The EYFS states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a849.3/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Before a child is admitted to the setting, you must obtain information about any special dietary requirements, preferences and food allergies that the child has, and any special health requirements.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a849.3/12\">Providers must have a policy and procedures for administering medicines, and they must have systems for obtaining information about a child&#8217;s medicine needs and for keeping this information up to date. Training must be provided for staff where the administering of medicine requires medical or technical knowledge.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/13\">Within all early years settings, there is a requirement for at least one person with a current paediatric first aid certificate to be on the premises and available at all times when children are present, and they must accompany children on outings. The PFA criteria are clear that the training should include being able to help a baby or child who is suffering from anaphylactic shock.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/14\">Last September, we changed the adequate supervision requirement in the early years foundation stage to be explicit that adequate supervision while children are eating meals means that children must always be in sight and hearing of an adult, rather than within sight or hearing. This will help practitioners to see the signs of an allergic reaction as soon as they are present, and it will allow them to act quickly.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/15\">The new early years educator level 3 qualification criteria will also come into force in September, ensuring that early years practitioners have an understanding of allergies and anaphylaxis. In April 2024, the Department published nutrition content on the &#8220;help for early years providers&#8221; online platform. The content includes a section on allergies and anaphylaxis to help early years providers prevent allergic reactions, to recognise the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock, and to know what to do if they occur.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/16\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">22 April</phrase>, the Department launched a consultation on the safeguarding requirements in the EYFS. One of the proposals is the inclusion of a safer eating section, which includes requirements for all staff to be aware of  the symptoms and treatments for allergies and anaphylaxis, and to obtain allergy action plans for children with allergies. We plan to publish our response to that consultation in the autumn.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/17\">I have outlined the various pieces of legislation and guidance that cover allergies in school. Given the complexity and individual nature of food allergies, the Government&#8217;s view is that it would not be appropriate for the Department for Education to legislate for food providers to cater for all requirements. However, through legislation, the minimum standards for school food have been clearly set out. Beyond that, headteachers, school governors and their caterers are best placed to make decisions about their school food policies that take into account local circumstances.</p>',\n",

Will the Minister confirm that is correct? What inflationary measure will be used to do that? Every household in Scotland, and up and down the UK, knows the impact the current Government have had on borrowing overall. Crashing the economy and trebling the national debt has had consequences for everyone. The interest payments on Government debt alone as a share of the economy are now the highest since in early 1950s.</p><p pid=\"a807.2/3\">Thanks to the former Prime Minister&#8217;s disastrous premiership, interest rates that homeowners are now paying have gone through the roof, taking away home ownership for many in this country. We are in the midst of a cost of living crisis that was made in Downing Street but is being paid for by working people all over the country. If it is possible to sum up this dreadful Government in one individual&#8217;s actions and behaviours, it is the crashing of the economy, accompanied by the highest tax burden on working people in 70 years, and the largest fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s. They are reckless, incompetent and unapologetic for the chaos they have wrought across the country.</p><p pid=\"a807.2/4\">But the Government seem to want to go further. They have looked at the former Prime Minister&#8217;s chaos inflicted on the country by the &#163;45 billion unfunded tax cuts for the richest, and decided to trump that with a &#163;46 billion unfunded tax cut to scrap national insurance, but will not tell us how they will pay for it. [Interruption.] There is chuntering from the Treasury Bench. Instead of chuntering, perhaps they will tell us how they will pay for that &#163;46 billion unfunded commitment. When the Minister responds, will he take the opportunity of this rare occasion of a Scottish statutory instrument being discussed on the Floor of the House to answer my fifth question, about where the money for the &#163;46 billion unfunded commitment will come from?</p><p pid=\"a807.2/5\">We have had three failed Prime Ministers in the UK over as many years, an embarrassing statistic the SNP could not help but match, with three First Ministers in Scotland in as many years. They have brought back former leaders to take charge, although the party in government in this Parliament have not done that for the top job, or certainly not for now anyway. Scotland is governed by a man who is responsible for many of the problems we face in the first place&#8212;he will have to take charge of these borrowing requirements&#8212;the Education Secretary who wrecked our education system, the Finance Secretary who decimated local government finance and the leader who led them to their worst ever election result.</p>',\n",

I wish it well as it moves through the other place, but it is important to acknowledge that it shines a spotlight on the Government&#8217;s lack of action to deal with the crisis in our schools. Significantly, that was highlighted by Sir Kevan Collins when he resigned as education recovery commissioner in 2021. In describing the Government&#8217;s catch-up plan as &#8220;feeble&#8221;, he highlighted how there was not the intervention that we need to secure our children&#8217;s future effectively. That is why we need much more urgent action from Ministers on how they intend to tackle this problem. Tinkering around the edges simply will not do. We need a proper long-term plan, and if the Government will not deliver it, despite the right hon. Lady&#8217;s best efforts, the next Labour Government will do so.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"c234.0/1\">I congratulate <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Preet Kaur Gill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25666\">the hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Preet Kaur Gill)</phrase> on securing this evening&#8217;s debate. Let me start by providing some national context before answering some of her questions. She mentioned a number of crime figures in her speech, and it is important to put on record that two sets of crime statistics are published: there is police recorded crime, which are the figures she is quoting, and then there is the crime survey for England and Wales produced by the Office for National Statistics. The police recorded crime figures depend on the propensity of the public to report and how good a job the police do in recording those crimes. Over the last five or seven years, the police have become a lot better at recording all the crimes reported to them, and that is why those numbers have gone up.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/2\">However, the Office for National Statistics tells us that the most reliable set of figures for long-term crime trends are not the police reported crimes figures for the reasons I have set out&#8212;they depend on the public&#8217;s propensity to report and the police&#8217;s ability to record them&#8212;but the crime survey. Let me give the hon. Lady some of the crime survey figures since 2010, which she mentioned as a reference period. On a like-for-like basis, all crime has come down by 54% since 2010, according to the independent Office for National Statistics, while violence is down by 46%, theft by 47%, domestic burglary by 55%, and vehicle theft by 39%. There is a lot more to do, particularly on shoplifting, vehicle crime and knife crime, which I will come to in a moment, but the overall crime trends are down.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/3\">On resources, which the hon. Lady mentioned a few times, across England and Wales as a whole, we now have record numbers of police officers. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">31 March</phrase> last year, we reached 149,566 police officers. That is more than we have ever had before, and it surpasses the previous peak, which was in March 2010, by about 3,500 officers. So we have record police numbers, and those have broadly speaking been maintained since that record was reached in March last year.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/4\">On West Midlands police specifically, its budget this year was &#163;790 million, which is an increase of &#163;51 million year on year, or about 6.4%&#8212;considerably higher than the current rate of inflation. I think many of the questions the hon. Lady is asking are questions she should be addressing to Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, who somehow managed to get re-elected a couple of weeks ago, because he has those financial resources. Whereas other police areas around the country have hit record numbers, as has the total, that has not happened in the West Midlands. That is a question I would strongly encourage her to ask Mr Foster, now that he has somehow got himself re-elected.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/5\">The hon. Lady asked several questions about specific crime types. She went through quite a long list, so I will quickly go through some of the more important of  them. She mentioned, for example, knife crime, which is a concern. The number of people getting admitted to hospital with an injury by a knife has come down by 26% in the last five years, but there is further to go. London is conspicuously much worse than the rest of the country. In the rest of the country, a lot more progress is being made, but there is an exception in London.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/6\">We are doing quite a lot to combat this. First, we are encouraging a greater use of stop and search&#8212;done respectfully, of course. That takes knives off the streets, and we would welcome cross-party support for the police to lawfully use stop and search more to get dangerous knives off the street. Secondly, we are investing in various forms of technology. In fact, just this lunch time I was with a company&#8212;an American company&#8212;that is developing a new technology that can scan somebody walking down a street to see whether they are carrying a knife, and it can distinguish a knife from a mobile phone or something else. It is not quite ready to deploy yet, but I think it will be ready to deploy experimentally this year. I think that could revolutionise our ability to look at a crowd and detect who in that crowd is carrying a knife, and then make sure they are stopped, the knife is taken off them and they are arrested.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/7\">We are also doing quite a lot of work on prevention, and the hon. Lady mentioned youth services. Notoriously, Birmingham City Council went bankrupt, but the Home Office is directly funding violence reduction units, to the tune of more than &#163;50 million a year across the country, which are designed to work with young people&#8212;whether it is with mentoring, work experience, cognitive behavioural therapy or youth activities, sometimes in partnership with football clubs&#8212;to help get them on to a better path.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/8\">The Youth Endowment Fund does lots of work here&#8212;it has &#163;200 million&#8212;and I commend the work of Jon Yates, the chief executive. From next year, there is going to be a &#163;75 million increase in violence reduction unit funding over three years, which is about a 50% increase because, as the hon. Lady says, supporting those young people is so important. This autumn, we will also be piloting, with the Youth Endowment Fund, a new initiative to try to identify the 50 or so of young people or early teenagers who are most at risk of getting into serious violence and serious crime. That includes looking at a range of indicators, such as mental health, education, housing or having an older sibling who is involved in a gang&#8212;indicators that go beyond criminal justice, so that interventions can be made to stop a vulnerable or at-risk 12 or 13-year-old becoming a violent 17 or 18-year-old. That initiative has the potential to make a real difference.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/9\">The hon. Lady talked about car crime, and crime more widely, which is a concern. I recently met the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover to discuss exactly this point. We are stepping up work on car crime, and are working with the National Police Chiefs&#8217; Council lead, Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims of the Merseyside force. Stolen cars are often sold and rapidly exported in containers to countries including the United Arab Emirates and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We will do more work to stop that export at the border. We will also increase the amount of intelligence work done, so that we can spot patterns and identify the organised criminal gangs who are often stealing these cars.</p>',\n",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Grahame Morris\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24715\">the Member for Easington (Grahame Morris)</phrase>, on securing this afternoon&#8217;s important debate. For the last 23 years, I have had the privilege of representing North Durham, which was part of the once mighty Durham coalfield. Over those 23 years, I have seen many changes.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/2\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Lavery\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24963\">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> spoke about the close-knit tradition of mining communities&#8212;not just in County Durham, but in his own area in Northumberland. Having grown up as the  son of a miner, I am familiar with that close-knit tradition and the reliability of work that there was in such communities. However, I do not look at the past through rose-tinted spectacles, because, to use a Hobbesian phrase, life was nasty, brutish and short for many people. There was nothing romantic about the death rates, which we just accepted as the price of coal, but many of the communities in my constituency&#8212;the town of Stanley, for example&#8212;were built on coal. The surrounding villages, such as Craghead, Sacriston and others, were all built because of coalmining. Their economic existence was coalmining. When that was finally taken away in 1985, when the last pits closed, the economic heart was ripped out of those communities overnight, as has been mentioned by many hon. Members who have contributed to today&#8217;s debate.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/3\">Today, people would not recognise where the mining industry was based in North Durham unless they know the history of the area. They would certainly not know where the pit was in the South Yorkshire village where I grew up if they did not know the history of that village. That unseen legacy has cast a long shadow over many mining communities. I congratulate the Coalfields Regeneration Trust on its excellent report on the state of coalfield communities in 2020. It is a superb piece  of work.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/4\">When I was first elected, the legacy of heavy industry, and certainly coalmining, was evident in my constituency. People who had worked underground their whole life suffered from not only debilitating lung disease, but other physical conditions related to heavy industry. Sadly, that generation is increasingly no longer with us.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/5\">After that social fabric was taken out of County Durham, we had unemployment, deprivation and poverty and, as happens in many communities, crime and drugs filled the gap. When I was first elected, I described North Durham as a rural constituency with urban problems and, as in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Easington and for Wansbeck, the legacy of drug abuse, for example, is still there today. This health inequality is now affecting a lost generation of younger people born in the 1980s, some now in their 40s, who never got into proper paid employment.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/6\">The report from the Coalfields Regeneration Trust speaks for itself. Life expectancy in coalfield communities is 82 for women, as opposed to 85 in the south-east of England, and 78 for men, as opposed to 81 in the south-east of England. The other thing that appals me&#8212;I have spoken about this before, and I feel very passionately about it&#8212;is that, in a wealthy country, life expectancy in County Durham has gone down over the last 10 years, which is an absolute disgrace. The report also outlines that, in 2021, the proportion of the population reporting bad or very bad health was 7.1% in former coalfield areas, compared with 4.2% in the south-east of England and 4.3% in London.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/7\">We have a legacy of ill health. Health professionals in County Durham tell me that the age at which people access intensive healthcare is now in their mid-to-late 50s. That puts extra pressure on our health services, which is not reflected in the funding. In addition, my constituency is now in the commuter belt for Tyneside and other areas, which is very difficult for people in many outlying communities unless they have access to a car. Young people do not have aspiration, which is  difficult to raise, to get into good, well-paid employment. Warehousing and other low-skilled or semi-skilled work are no replacement for the high-quality jobs that we used to have in the coalfields.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/8\">We have heard a lot of talk from the Government about levelling up. I have said it before and will say it again: levelling up is a complete con. It is not a serious measure to level up Britain. If it were, the communities highlighted by the report would be at the top of the list. It is all about capital projects and pork barrel politics, basically setting areas against one another. Councils have spent millions of pounds, certainly in County Durham&#8217;s case, submitting bids that were never going to succeed. The only successful bid from County Durham was in Bishop Auckland, which happened to have a Conservative Member of Parliament, getting half a bypass in the process.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/9\">Levelling up has not replaced the &#163;240 million that the Government have taken out of Durham County Council&#8217;s core funding by shifting the tax base on to local council tax payers. My hon. Friend the Member for Easington spoke about the low council tax base in County Durham, where 60% of properties are in band A, which means that we cannot raise money.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/10\">Additionally, we need extra services for our growing elderly population and our growing number of looked-after children. Is there a relationship between the closure of Sure Start centres, which offered early intervention for families, and the number of looked-after children who are coming back into care? It does not take a genius to work out that the two are related, and the Government have slowly woken up to that fact and are now reintroducing children&#8217;s centres.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/11\">We also had access to European regional development funding. Again, it was promised that no region would lose out, but we have. That money automatically came to areas like the north-east, and it did some fantastic work. It did not fixate on capital projects, at which the local Member of Parliament or whoever wanted to be elected could open a plaque; it was about employment and training. I worked with my hon. Friend the Member for Easington on DurhamWorks, which has been very good at getting young people who are not in education, employment or training back into work.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/12\">Levelling up has been a complete con, and we need that investment if we are to make a real change to health, employment and training. The Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag when he stood for the leadership of the Tory party and boasted that he would take money away from areas like mine and redistribute it to leafier parts of the south-east of England. That is exactly what has happened, and the idea that the Government can take the needs-based element out of this is absolutely disgraceful. The idea that they can give coalfield areas the odd &#163;20 million here and there to replace the hundreds of millions of pounds that they have lost in local government funding, ERDF funding and other funding is just a con.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/13\">I look back to the last Labour Government with clear eyes. County Durham had five new schools, three new health centres, a new hospital and two new further education colleges. That is real investment in a community. I am also proud that, in government, we paid compensation to people with COPD, which should have been done many years earlier. It took a Labour Government to do that.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/14\">We need a radical change of approach, which no one can foresee at the fag end of this Parliament. It will only happen with the election of a Labour Government who will reprioritise the needs of individuals. Without that, the legacy of limited employment opportunities and ill health in our coalmining communities will continue, not just for those who worked in the industry but for generations to come. In a wealthy country like Britain, it is a national scandal that we should leave such communities to suffer in this way.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"c641.1/1\">I will give the hon. Lady the courtesy of addressing new clause 7 in due course. She is right to highlight that the new rate for small businesses will keep around 70% of businesses in the country at 19% when those that are most profitable move to 25%, but look at the entire package of support for small businesses. It shows that the Government are supportive of our high streets and small business entrepreneurs across the country, whether that is through the increase in VAT thresholds, the 75% rate relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses, or all the support that we provided during the covid pandemic and throughout the energy shock, including the energy bill relief scheme and the energy bills support scheme. I put it to her that we are behind our small businesses. We regard them as the engine of our growth, and we will continue to do everything we can to support them. I will come on to new clause 7 in a moment, if I may.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/2\">New clause 3 would require a review of the possible impacts of the energy security investment mechanism on energy profits levy revenues, and on investment decisions in the oil and gas sector. It would require this assessment to be made on the basis of the end date of the EPL falling before the end of the next Parliament.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/3\">The Government have already published the tax information and impact note, which sets out the anticipated impact of the energy security investment mechanism&#8212;the ESIM. This indicates clearly that the mechanism will  give operators and lenders to the oil and gas industry confidence in the fiscal regime while the EPL remains over the next Parliament. Based on the OBR&#8217;s current price projections, the ESIM is not predicted to trigger before the end of the EPL in March 2029, and is therefore expected to have no impact on EPL revenues. In addition, should there be interest in calculating forgone revenue if the EPL were to end in a particular year, the OBR has published projected EPL revenues over the forecast period, and the impact of the EPL ending early can be calculated from this publicly available information that is there for all to see.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/4\">Regarding the assessment of the investment decisions within the oil and gas sector, the Government have been clear that they want oil and gas companies to reinvest their profits here in the United Kingdom, and by legislating for the ESIM we are giving these companies and their investors the confidence that if prices fall, the EPL will cease. This allows the sector to continue investing in the economy, in jobs and in UK energy security while ensuring fairness to the taxpayer, as I said earlier. Indeed, when the ESIM was first introduced, the Offshore Energies UK trade body agreed that the ESIM was a step in the right direction to support confidence and investment in the sector. However, it should be noted that there are of course commercial decisions to be made, and it is not possible for the Government to make an assessment of the impacts of the ESIM on the decisions of commercial organisations.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/5\">New clause 7 seeks the laying of a report before this House within three months, assessing the impact of clause 13 on how small and medium enterprises manage their costs. The introduction of the small profits rate last year kept the rate of corporation tax at 19% for companies with profits of less than &#163;50,000, and the availability of marginal relief means that companies with profits between &#163;50,000 and &#163;250,000 pay below the main rate of 25%. This ensures that companies have greater post-tax profits to reinvest, to distribute and to retain to cover future costs and any shocks in the economy. Clause 13 simply maintains this approach from April 2025 onwards, providing advance certainty to taxpayers.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/6\">More broadly, it should be noted that our corporation tax rules are based on the fundamental principle of taxing profits net of costs. HMRC already releases its corporation tax statistics publication annually, which breaks down data on corporation tax liabilities by the size of company. Once tax returns covering the period since the small profits rate was introduced come in, this will be reflected in the data, but I am afraid that that will not happen within the next three months.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/7\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Christopher Chope\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10103\">the Member for Christchurch (Sir Christopher Chope)</phrase> made a typically colourful speech. He made some very valid points, with which many in the Committee will agree. We all want tax to come down. As I said to <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sarah Olney\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25596\">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney)</phrase>, we have included a provision and a rate to ensure that 70% of businesses&#8212;the smallest, least profitable businesses&#8212;maintain a rate of 19%. We had to increase the rate in the face of an incredibly challenging environment on the back of covid and the war in Ukraine, when the Government stepped in with significant support for businesses, families and individuals  across the country. I can tell my hon. Friend that the extension to 25% will raise &#163;85 billion, which will help to reduce our debt over the long term.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/8\">We have introduced full permanent expensing, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and I think it is fair to say that he was sceptical of that. However, it was called for directly and clearly by the CBI, Make UK and a number of businesses that want to reinvest their profits into other endeavours and into plant and machinery. I put it to him that we should be looking at the effective rate of taxation for a business, not just the headline rate, but that our headline rate for the largest, most profitable businesses is, at 25%, still the lowest in the G7, which is the most comparable mix of countries to look at.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/9\">Of course we want to see tax simplification in all our fiscal statements, which is why we decided to abolish multiple dwellings relief in our last fiscal event. It is also why the Chancellor has set out his long-term ambition to abolish national insurance contributions, which would simplify our tax system substantially.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/10\">This is all in the context of a country that remains one of the most competitive in the world, but it is not just about taxation; it is about planning, our rule of law and our amazing educational institutions. That is why Tata recently invested in a 40 GW gigafactory in Somerset, it is why &#216;rsted has decided to build the world&#8217;s biggest offshore wind farm in this country, and it is why AstraZeneca has decided to invest &#163;450 million in a new R&amp;D centre.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/11\">Investors look at a range of factors. It is not just about taxation; it is also about regulation. It is remarkable that the shadow Minister did not mention the Labour deputy leader&#8217;s obsession with introducing 70 new regulations on business, which would hinder business investment. It is the certainty of a Labour Government&#8217;s introduction of regulation that will hinder business investment, not anything that this Government have done in office. Looking at our achievements when it comes to business investment, the facts remain clear.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"b520.0/1\">Earlier this afternoon I counted over 50 right hon. and hon. Members of the Labour party alone packing the Opposition Benches for the urgent question on the middle east. Sadly, though predictably, by the time we got to this important debate we were down to the usual suspects&#8212;the usual stalwarts, about half a dozen to a dozen Members on each side of the House. That difference in the numbers is relevant: the reason for it is that an actual war is going on in the middle east, so people are very focused on it, now that it is too late to prevent it. Our purpose in holding debates such as this one should be not to get to that situation.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/2\">I have some reservations about the constant references to us being in a pre-war world. I know what the Secretary of State and others mean when they refer to that, but it can be taken as meaning that we are in a situation where war is inevitable, and it is not. We have to behave as if we were going to have to defend ourselves in a real war, because if we make those preparations adequately, we will, through a policy of deterrence, prevent the war from happening in the first place.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/3\">This close to a general election, it is perhaps inevitable that we will hear people on both sides of the House, but on the Front Benches in particular, quibbling over percentage points of GDP being allocated to defence expenditure. But I have to say that 2.5%, 3% or even 4% would not be anything like adequate if a war actually broke out&#8212;44% is probably more like what we would have to spend. This is not just about a loss of treasure; even worse, it is about the human suffering and loss of life that would happen if we fail to invest adequately in peacetime to prevent that from ever coming to pass.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/4\">The economist Roger Bootle recently explained:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b520.0/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;During the Second World War, we spent roughly 50% of GDP on the military and slightly more than this in 1916 and 1917, during the First World War.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"b520.0/6\">So for goodness sake, let us be serious about this. No Government can be exonerated for the Kool-Aid that they drank after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/7\">During the 2015-17 Parliament, the Defence Committee spent a bit of time trying to establish what had happened to defence expenditure in the post-war era. What we found was this: in 1963 we spent similar sums&#8212;about 6% of GDP&#8212;on both welfare and defence; and by 2017, after the study was carried out, we were spending six times  as much on welfare as we were spending on defence. Similarly, it was found that in the mid-1980s we had been spending similar sums&#8212;about 5% of GDP then&#8212;on education, health and defence. By 2017 we were spending 2.5 times as much on education and nearly four times as much on health as we were spending on defence.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/8\">At the height of the cold war confrontation, and every year from 1981 to 1987, we spent between 4.3% and 5.1% of GDP on defence. From 1988&#8212;when the cold war began to evaporate&#8212;until 2014, defence spending almost halved as a proportion of GDP. Of course, there was a reason for that: it appeared that the threat from Russia had gone away. Well, now it is back. The question is this: are we prepared to revert to the sort of investment in defence in &#8220;peacetime&#8221; that we made so successfully during the 50 years of the cold war, which prevented an outbreak&#8212;a terrible further global conflict&#8212;between the then superpowers, both of which were armed with nuclear weapons?</p><p pid=\"b520.0/9\">I revert to what I said in an intervention on the Secretary of State when he was opening the debate: everything depends on what happens in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Let us be honest that when the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine arose in early 2022, not many people&#8212;hardly any in this Chamber, I suspect, myself included&#8212;predicted that Ukraine would be as successful as it has proved to be in resisting the might of the Russian invasion. I suspect that what had made that possible was that the shock that they had experienced in previous years over the loss of Crimea, which, if I remember correctly, was taken over by the Russians quite easily, focused their minds, their efforts and their investment upon the dire possibility that Russia might come back for more. That is why Ukraine was so much better prepared, with the covert assistance of other countries, not least this one, to resist the second Russian invasion when it happened.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/10\">I cannot stress too strongly that Ukraine&#8217;s battle is our battle. If Putin is seen to be unsuccessful in Ukraine, then the threat to us and to the rest of NATO will recede for a generation. However, if he is able to claim some sort of success, by ending up with significantly more territory at the end of the process than he had under his control in February 2022, then it will only be a matter of time before he comes back for more.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/11\">I want to say a few words about the middle east, but they are not actually my words; they are words from a remarkably perceptive article written by a Member of the upper House, the noble Lord Hague&#8212;William Hague, to us. He outlined his reaction to the atrocities of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">7 October</phrase> in an astonishingly perceptive way in The Times within 48 hours of that attack. I want to set some of what he said on the record, because he raised the question of why on earth Hamas should have undertaken such an action when they must have known it would provoke a horrifying response. He asked the question:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b520.0/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Why, as well as murdering hundreds of defenceless young people at a rave, parade dead bodies as evidence of the atrocities? The answer is that their objective is uncontrolled rage. It is to make Israel lash out in a way that starts a conflagration. To start a war so intense that it spreads, igniting an explosion of violence in the West Bank and bringing in Hezbollah from Lebanon in the north, with Israel fighting on multiple fronts. To see so many   Palestinians killed that the Israelis lose the moral high ground of defending themselves against mass murder. To use the fate of hostages, with maximum cruelty, to intensify a frenzy of hatred whenever that seems to be abating.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"b520.0/13\">That is still going on now. We heard reference to the Israeli soldiers recently killed in a Hamas artillery strike close to the one entrance where aid was coming into Palestine. Guess what happened? The Israelis immediately closed that entrance, thus intensifying the crisis. The Hamas strategists clearly know what they are doing. It is horrible&#8212;devilish&#8212; but there is a cruel logic to it.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/14\">The heading that Lord Hague&#8212;or his sub-editor at The Times&#8212;used for that article was:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b520.0/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Hamas has set a trap that Israel must avoid: Iranian-backed attacks are desperate attempts to halt growing collaboration with Saudi Arabia and the UAE&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/16\">The only element that was missing in the article was that that strategy, promoted by Iran, was also extremely beneficial to Russia, because now we spend rather more time considering what is happening in Israel and Gaza than we spend considering what is happening between Russia and Ukraine, despite the fact that what is happening between Russia and Ukraine cannot be emphasised too often because it is of crucial significance to the future peace, or lack of peace, of NATO countries vis-&#224;-vis the Russian threat.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/17\">I will close with some remarks about the nuclear deterrent, which has been touched on a few times. One of the votes took place under Labour, as we have heard, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">14 March 2007</phrase>, when there was a substantial majority for the deterrent. Parliament voted by 409 votes to 161 in favour of proceeding with the initial gate for the renewal of the Trident submarine fleet; but even that huge majority of 248 was eclipsed on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">18 July 2016</phrase>, when under the Conservative Government&#8212;free from the coalition&#8212;the majority rose to 355 when MPs voted for the decisive main gate stage to proceed. That vote was won by 472 votes to 117.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/18\">That shows near unanimity in the House for the maintenance of our strategic nuclear deterrent&#8212;and all that happened before the various crises that we have been concentrating on today. Let us hope that unity prevails. I, for one, welcome the comments of the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, who said that his party is now committed to four submarines and to the maintenance of the continuous at-sea deterrent, which presumably means with the use of Trident missiles. I say &#8220;use&#8221; because they are used every day of the week. Their use is as a deterrent. If ever&#8212;heaven forbid&#8212;they had to be fired, they would fail in their purpose.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/19\">We have come a long way and we have made a lot of progress. It is just as well that we are united, given the way in which the international scene has darkened, but both Front Benches have a long way to go if they are to reach a stage where we are making the sort of investment, the sort of insurance and the sort of effort that has to be made to deter an aggressive Russia and to ensure that Ukraine prevails.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"b400.0/1\">I thank and commend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10785\">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase> for leading today&#8217;s debate. I attended his half-hour Westminster Hall debate on this issue and  supported him when he outlined his case in the short time he had. He has done exceptionally well today in doing the same thing, but in much more detail.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/2\">It is important to discuss pension schemes, and to ensure they are properly understood and regulated. There are still so many people out there who are misinformed, or do not really understand how pensions work or what their purpose is, so I am glad to be able to debate this issue. The Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Timms\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10596\">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms)</phrase>, referred to auto-enrolment. I want to refer to it, too. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland set out a lot of detail, as did the Chair of the Select Committee and others, referring to a number of companies. Most people will obtain a pension at some stage of their lives and, through employment, will actively pay into it.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/3\">One point I would like to make, and which the Chair of the Select Committee referred to, relates to the provision of pensions for our young people and what steps we can take to ensure they understand that provision. This is another issue that I believe should be taught within learning for life and work. It should be in the curriculum and a part of our focus. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said that he had his first pension at the age of 22. I had my first pension at the age of 18. My mother took me down to John Thompson &#8212;he is not here any more&#8212;who was the pension man in Ballywalter. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need one.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Oh, you do.&#8221; And I signed up. Of course, you never say no to your mum. I certainly didn&#8217;t and I do not regret that. Over the years, and after taking out other pensions, all of a sudden they are quite valuable and exceptionally good to have. Also when I was an 18-year-old, my mother took me down to the Northern Bank&#8212;now Danske Bank &#8212;and opened an account for me. She gave me &#163;10 to start the account. Way back in the &#8217;60s, that was quite a lot of money. You could probably have bought a wee car at that time. I am not sure what state the car would have been in, but I think you could have bought one for &#163;10 or thereabouts. The point I am making is that it is important to save and to have a pension.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/4\">We ask young people to look to their future and to start to plan, but there is little provision within the education system to teach them about pensions, savings and mortgages, and there should be. I know that that is not the Minister&#8217;s direct responsibility, but perhaps he could give some assurance on whether it could become a subject for the curriculum. I have had conversations with my staff on the importance of paying into pensions. My youngest staff member&#8217;s response was exactly that. She bought her first house, saving for almost a decade for the deposit and paying thousands of pounds for mortgage advisers, insurance, solicitors fees and lenders fees. Young people are just about surviving to live in the present, but there is now an expectation that they must save in a pension for their futures. The purchase of a house is such a critical factor that a pension often takes second place. What steps can be taken to ease the financial burdens on our young people and enable them to see the benefits of taking advantage of pensions?</p><p pid=\"b400.0/5\">I recently asked a parliamentary question on considerations being given to a potential opt-in scheme for young people under the age of 18. There is massive  cause for this. Another two girls in my office have been working since the age of 13&#8212;part time, obviously, but still working&#8212;and so many young people out there are employed from as young as that. Why shouldn&#8217;t they reap some sort of benefit from working at that age? I understand the Government are to make a change to the Pensions (Extension of Automatic Enrolment) Act 2023 to enable that to happen in the &#8220;mid-2020s&#8221;. As we quickly approach that, perhaps the Minister could give an update on the matter and where it stands.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/6\">My last point on pensions relates to the WASPI women. This is not the subject of today&#8217;s debate, and there will be a debate on it in a fortnight&#8217;s time. I secured a debate last month in Westminster Hall on the issue. Although it is not the pension issue for today&#8217;s debate, the scale of the issue and its popularity highlights the importance of planning pensions. That is the point I want to refer to. The Minister will be aware that compensation is owed, but, given the nature of today&#8217;s debate, let me gently remind him that it is possible for lessons to be learnt. In setting the scene, the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland spoke of what had gone wrong and the need to ensure that it would not happen again, and we hope that, as a result of this debate and others, the issue of the WASPI women will never happen again either.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/7\">The incentive to save for the future must be there for people of all ages, not just young people but those in their 30s and 40s who voluntarily do not pay into their pensions because they do not think it worth their while, given the current cost of living and the many demands on their purses. It is also worth noting that some employers match employee contributions, while others pay considerably more. The incentive must be there for people to prepare for life after work, and I firmly believe that that should start in the LLW and careers sector of the education system. We should &#8220;learn them early&#8221;. We should reach young people in the right way and prepare them for the world that is to come, and pensions are clearly a part of that.</p>',\n",

He is held in high esteem in this House, in Parliament and in the outside world for the role that he played in that operation.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/2\">I was coming on to say that the reason why I have never been able to watch that programme again is that it was horrific. I was not in the services, and I did not go out to Bosnia. I watched that drama in my very early 20s, and I found it so horrific that even though it has been repeated since, and even though it is excellent, I have not been able to watch it. That must not be forgotten. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Foord\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/26086\">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Richard Foord)</phrase> outlined some of the horrific scenes that took place&#8212;the butchery, the savagery, the hatred that led decent people and neighbours to carry out those acts. We have to recognise them in this House and never forget.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/3\">I had the privilege of being the international chairman of the Conservative party for a period. We did a lot of work with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, a body through which Labour, Liberals and Conservatives work with their sister parties to help build democracies. It was set up after the Cold War. I am proud that I was able to work with three factions from the centre right in Bosnia, to get those right-wing parties around the table, talking and working towards developing a better future. I used to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether this will have any long-term effect, but at least I can one day look my maker in the eye and say that I tried.&#8221; I had a very tiny part in trying to make peace last, because that is what we have to do.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/4\">Tragically, in my opinion, Republika Srpska representatives did not turn up to the Rose-Roth seminar of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in November, apart from one person who very bravely did and got a hell of a lot of pushback for it. Its representatives have been disengaging. That is what I mean when I talk about the dangerous path that they are on. Take the history of the second world war. By about the 1960s, German society started to teach about the holocaust. That was a very important moment; it turned to education to make sure that history could not repeat itself. In Bosnia, however, not only are people not talking about some of the crimes against humanity that took place during the war, but in some of the schools in Republika Srpska, they are actually saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s lies&#8212;it didn&#8217;t happen. This the problem. We&#8217;ve got to separate out.&#8221; We should be highly concerned about that.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/5\">What lies behind all that is the arm of Russia. I have heard that Russia is not directly involved. It is not supplying arms; it is not doing some of the things that it has done in other parts of the world, such as Syria and Ukraine. However, the hand of Russia is there, politically and disruptively, and we do not have to look very far to see it. This is a critical moment.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/6\">My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton and my right hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham used the word &#8220;deterrent&#8221;. One thing we could do today is take a British battalion, in a NATO-led operation, to those areas, and act as a deterrent. I do not want any forces to have to try to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians. We now have an opportunity, in that the Minister is here to take these points back to the Foreign Office. I know that Ministers are always constrained in what they can and cannot say at the Dispatch Box, but we have to send a clear message in this debate.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/7\">History does not have to repeat itself. We do not have to have programmes that I have only ever been able to watch once in my life because I found them too horrific for me, let alone for the many Members of this House who served in Bosnia, or those now in the other place who were Ministers at the time, and had to deal with the consequences. There is ongoing trauma. I have met service personnel, some of whom served under my right hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, and I have heard and seen the deep distress that they live with to this day, having tried to protect innocent civilians. That does not have to happen again. We can, and we need to, take action this day. That is the responsibility of the developed western world. It has responsibility for managing its military, and for the ethics that we apply to stop those who, purely as part of power-grabbing political games, play the nationalistic card, which will lead to murdered civilians. We see that today in Ukraine because we did nothing after Crimea.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"b995.1/1\">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman up to a point, and of course young people do not magically become much more self-sustainable and resilient the day after their 18th birthday, but there have been many improvements over the years. There is extended support for care leavers up to the age of 25, and there are arrangements whereby they can still have a relationship, including a financial relationship, for example with foster carers, through the &#8220;staying put&#8221; scheme the Government have come up with, and many charities and organisations do very good work in providing support, but the point the right hon. Gentleman makes is right. Most of us are lucky enough to be able to go running back home to birth families for help and support in difficult times, but that is not always available to young people in the care system, although many do have the continual support of good quality foster carers and other carers they relied on when they were under the age of 18. However, they are vulnerable, and ensuring these young people have a safe and stable home to start their adult lives is really crucial.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/2\">Housing can act as a vehicle for stability, and without access to good quality accommodation young people will face challenges in getting a job, staying in education and ongoing training, accessing health services and everything else. However, despite the key role housing can play in helping a young person transitioning to  independent living, many care leavers are struggling to find suitable accommodation in those early years after leaving care. It is estimated that one in three care leavers become homeless in the first two years immediately after they leave care, and one in four homeless people have been in care at some point in their lives, as I mentioned earlier.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/3\">Young care leavers face many barriers in accessing appropriate accommodation, and many will not be able to be addressed in this Bill. However, it does offer an opportunity to address one of those barriers: that landlords sometimes feel reluctant to rent to young people who have grown up in the care system. Young people in care tell charitable organisations in the youth sector that they come across landlords who are reluctant to rent to them because of their circumstances, and evidence from a survey of care leavers carried out by the charity Centrepoint found that over one in 10&#8212;some 13%&#8212;said they had been unable to access accommodation because the landlord was unwilling to accommodate them because of their status. That is not fair.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/4\">The problem is also likely to get worse given the growing evidence of a reduction in the number of private rental properties available across England. An investigation by the BBC found the number of properties available to rent across the whole of the UK had fallen by a third in the 18 months up to March 2023, and increased competition for the properties that are available has enabled more landlords to pick and choose which tenants they like, often going for the highest bidder, which of course makes it especially challenging for vulnerable groups such as care leavers.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/5\">In the last few years Barnardo&#8217;s has been running a campaign to try and improve access to suitable accommodation for care leavers. I certainly support the campaign, which calls on all local authorities to offer rent guarantor and deposit schemes for care leavers seeking to rent in the private rented sector. The MacAlister report on children in social care, which the Government commissioned and which was published last year, made a recommendation that being a care-experienced child should be a protected characteristic. So far in excess of 60 local authorities, including my own in West Sussex, have voluntarily acknowledged that, although the Government have not made it a statutory addition at this stage. So some local authorities are already providing help to care leavers, with deposits or a scheme where they can act as a corporate guarantor.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/6\">Such schemes greatly help make care-experienced young people more attractive tenants, and a number of local authorities report that such schemes have had significant successes. The scheme operated by Kent County Council has had no rent defaults from when it started in 2018 until 2021; however, such schemes are not offered by most local authorities. A freedom of information request by the Care Leaver Local Offer website to the 151 local authorities in England with a children&#8217;s social care department showed that 60% will not act as a guarantor for care leavers.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/7\">I understand Barnardo&#8217;s is currently in conversation with the Department for Education on how these schemes can be extended, with more local authorities being encouraged to develop them. That is welcome, but while such schemes will help, they will not be successful if  landlords continue to have a reluctance to rent to this group and instead pass them over in favour of younger professionals who can offer the backing of a family or personal guarantor or higher incomes on their own terms. That is why through this amendment I am urging the Minister to extend the provisions in the Bill to require landlords not to discriminate against certain groups of tenants including care leavers. Young people who have grown up in care have often faced very difficult circumstances in their lives, which is why they ended up in care, and when they came into the care of the state we agreed that we would become their corporate parent. I very much see the amendment as key to fulfilling this duty in providing important extra support to care leavers, ensuring more of them will be able to access safe and stable accommodation that they can call home.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/8\">In closing, I want to say that there is a basis for having a consideration for foster families as well. I know from my experience working with fostering groups that landlords can be reluctant to rent to foster families who have a number of children who will change and may be a little more problematic in some cases as well. However, foster families do an essential job and we are short of about 8,000 or 9,000 foster carers in this country, and the last thing we need is for them not to be able to offer a safe, stable, loving home to a child who has been through traumatic experiences because they cannot get into rented accommodation themselves as landlords do not want to be housing children who may be a little more challenging in some circumstances, but in most cases are not. So consideration must be given to the idea that landlords should regard foster-caring families as people to be encouraged because they are doing a noble and worthy job for vulnerable children, and, frankly, that is just the sort of tenant they should want to encourage. So perhaps in considering the way we treat care leavers themselves going out into the big wide world to rent we should also be mindful of the needs of foster carers, who have done such a fantastic job in picking those children and young people up and guiding them through to adulthood.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/9\">I want to secure the Minister&#8217;s commitment to work with colleagues particularly in the Department for Education, which has the lead responsibility for children in the care system, to consider how to involve landlords when developing new rent guarantor and deposit schemes for care leavers, and to agree to keep the issue under review with the possibility of using a power the Secretary of State has under the Bill to extend the non-discrimination clauses to groups such as children with care experience.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/10\">I know my hon. Friend the Minister is sympathetic to the thrust of my probing amendment and in his response and the Government&#8217;s official response on these matters we must send out a very clear signal that discriminating against children in the care system and care leavers is not on. People should have more of a duty of care to do everything they can to make sure those young people who have missed out on many of the things we take for granted&#8212;a safe and loving family at home&#8212;are not disadvantaged yet again by not being able to get a roof over their head. I hope the Minister will respond favourably to this probing amendment, and I am sure he will.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a908.5/1\">It would not be an Adjournment debate without the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s contribution and I am grateful to him for it, because his point is well made. The budget cuts we have seen in Derbyshire have come alongside an increase in the population and there is an argument, which many of us in Derbyshire have made, that the authority has been particularly badly treated on the finances. The point he makes is a very valid one.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/2\">When the UK and Derbyshire were both run by Labour administrations, there were 56 of these children&#8217;s centres, but after 14 years, if these plans are approved, there will be just 12. The centres provide essential services such as health visits, speech and language development, healthy eating, parenting, school readiness,  family support, parenting groups and help to improve family relationships. We know that the work done by the staff in the centres has a massive benefit to the children and families that they help.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/3\">I was first elected to this place in 2010. During the election campaign, the issue of whether Sure Start was safe if the Conservatives were elected was a key plank of the Labour party campaign. The Conservatives furiously denied Gordon Brown&#8217;s claims that one in five Sure Start centres would be endangered if the Conservatives were elected. Well, in Derbyshire, Gordon Brown was indeed wrong: we have seen not one in five of these children centres close, but four in five. Now, the Government wonder why they are spending more than ever on the costs of failure, but they have failed to invest in the early years. When the Minister responds, can he tell us whether he believes that the loss of 44 of Derbyshire&#8217;s 56 children centres during the past 14 years of a Conservative Government is primarily down to electing a Conservative Government or down to electing a Conservative council?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/4\">We will come on in due course to the authority&#8217;s failings in special needs education, but at every school I visit, experienced headteachers say to me that they have never seen so many children with serious special needs. Has anyone in the Government considered whether the stripping away of these early years services may be contributing to the huge increase in the number of children presenting on their first day at school without being school ready and often in need of support with speech and language, dressing and toileting?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/5\">The authority got in touch with me and with other Derbyshire MPs to ask us to lobby Ministers for more money, which I and many other MPs did, as the authority was being charged excessive amounts by private providers of children&#8217;s services. Derbyshire has embarked on a savage programme of privatisation of services and so would be vulnerable to private sector overcharging, because it has crippled the strong publicly provided services that it inherited.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/6\">One feature of this Administration&#8217;s approach has been the unfortunate habit of marrying serial incompetence with careless arrogance and indifference to public opinion. The closure of these buildings is a case in point. Jon Pearce, Labour&#8217;s parliamentary candidate in High Peak, has teamed up with local Labour councillors to support the community&#8217;s plan to create a community hub and preserve the centre at Gamesley, which houses a youth club and boxing club in one of Derbyshire&#8217;s most deprived communities. Those clubs were shocked to receive a call out of the blue from DCC to say that they had a matter of weeks to find another venue, because the decision had already been made to close the building.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/7\">The community is attempting to form a constituted community organisation and has secured a three-month extension, but it is engaged in a race against time. We have also recently heard that Derbyshire County Council is looking to close two thirds of the care homes that it manages, as well as eight older people day centres. The right to dignity in old age is a sacred covenant in this country. Old people should know that when they work hard for their entire life and make a contribution to society, they should be able to retire with a degree of comfort and security. I feel that the covenant is now disintegrating before our eyes.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/8\">The governor from a school in Brampton was in such despair at the situation that she attended the most recent full meeting of Derbyshire County Council to set out that, to meet budgetary constraints while continuing to deliver the required level of care, the school is being forced to cut 160 teaching hours a week.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/9\">The cost of living crisis, spiralling rents and ever increasing mortgage rates are destroying the social contract in real time, and the inability of a council to provide services that facilitate for the most in need is a damning indictment of 14 years of Tory rule and local mismanagement. This situation could mean 162 vulnerable residents being turfed out on to the street. The council is now closing its own centres and using the private sector more&#8212;it is spending more and getting less. Spending on private care homes has increased by 61% since 2018-19, at a time when the authority has had to close seven of its own care homes, losing 156 beds. It has also closed 140 beds in its remaining 16 care homes and has around 30 vacancies. Where is the county&#8217;s duty of care to those living in its care homes? It is not as if the council is efficient. While Labour-run Chesterfield continues to enjoy the lowest council tax in the country, the Tory administration on the council has raised council tax by almost 5%. The need for social care for adults is only going to grow and grow as people live longer lives. I am sure we can all agree that this is a good problem to have, but more funding is needed from Government if councils are to be able to provide essential services such as this. Can the Minister set out the guidance he has provided to county councils and authorities to plan for the delivery of services in the context of demographic change and real-terms cuts to budgets?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/10\">The children of Derbyshire are suffering massively under the current council leadership, too. Spending on private schools for children with special needs has increased from &#163;5.7 million in 2018-19 to &#163;24 million in 2023-24, according to the schools forum report, while investment in council provision falters. At almost every single one of my weekly surgeries, I have parents in attendance who have children with special needs who are unable to get into a dedicated special needs establishment. Often, these children are excluded from their mainstream school&#8212;these children are missing months or, in some cases, years of their schooling&#8212;and are unable to make a mainstream placement work, but unable to access specialist provision.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/11\">It can now be revealed that, throughout this period of hardship, Derbyshire County Council has received around &#163;17.5 million of capital funding from the Department for Education since 2019 for additional special school places, but has spent a paltry &#163;1.5 million. That means &#163;16 million, or 91% of the budget it has received, is sat in Derbyshire County Council&#8217;s coffers, while parents of special needs children lose sleep every night at the lack of provision in our county. It is nothing short of a betrayal of those parents and their children. What can the Minister do to work with colleagues in the Department for Education to get this dysfunctional authority to deliver special needs placements for Derbyshire children?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/12\">The case of Brampton Primary School, which I referred to earlier, encapsulates all that is wrong with Derbyshire County Council&#8217;s budget allocation and service delivery. The school has an excellent special needs unit, but also has a tremendous reputation for how it has supported special needs children within its mainstream provision.  As a result of this reputation, many parents from well outside the Brampton catchment area who have special needs children will choose it for their children. However, this reputation for inclusivity comes at a tremendous cost to Brampton.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/13\">The primary school has 317 children on its roll, with 31% of these children having SEN. It is proud of its reputation for creating a supportive environment for children who have additional needs, but each child who has an education, health and care plan has the first &#163;6,000 of their extra costs covered by the school before any central funding comes in. On top of that, dozens of children are waiting for special needs assessments from the overwhelmed county council education service. While the children and their families wait for their assessment to be heard, the school receives no additional funding for these pupils at all.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/14\">A school that has gone out of its way to support those who have the greatest needs is crushing into the rocks of an inadequate funding mechanism and a county education service that is failing to support those children. Can the Minister explain how we can ensure that schools such as Brampton are not penalised for their own success in supporting special needs children?</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"a1261.1/1\">Let me say again, as I have already this week, how much admiration I have for Madam Deputy Speaker, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Eleanor Laing\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10348\">the right hon. Member for Epping Forest (Dame Eleanor Laing)</phrase>, and the other Madam Deputy Speaker, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Rosie Winterton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10648\">the right hon. Member for Doncaster Central (Dame Rosie Winterton)</phrase>. They are both marvellous, inspiring, incredibly stylish women. Parliament, and the parliamentary hairdressers, will be all the poorer for their departure. I wish them both well in the future, and I am sure that we will see them again.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/2\">It is my pleasure to wind up this valedictory debate, at 6.44 pm on a Friday; I do not intend to make a habit of speaking in Parliament so late on a Friday. We have had 31 speeches today, all of which have been incredibly moving, powerful and emotional. As the main Labour person in the Chamber for the past four and a half hours, I have felt slightly like a gate-crasher at a private party, but I am glad to have been here. Today has shown that all of us in politics know that this is a vocation, not a job. It is a life in service, always in the public eye, and very rarely with an off switch. We have been reminded today, as we often are, that the constituents are the boss, and our families are the bedrock.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/3\">A huge amount of parliamentary experience is leaving this place today. I could not even add up the collective number of years of service by everybody who has spoken today. It is a huge amount, and we should recognise that for what it is. While I personally am excited for the general election, I have felt a great deal of sadness today and this week for so many people departing. I have felt today how many of my friends on the Government Benches are leaving. It has been a very emotional day for all of us. These really are the very best days in Parliament. I am sure that we can all agree on that. It has felt a little bit like the last day at high school, which today is for lots of year 11s and year 13s across the country. Perhaps we can all swap shirts at the end of the debate and sign them for each other. [Interruption.] Okay, well, we could all sign each other&#8217;s shirts&#8212;you know what I mean!</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/4\">One of the themes of contributions today is the importance of cross-party working, so I will try to respond in that spirit. How fitting it was that the two opening speeches were from such long-standing, powerful women Members of Parliament. This has been very different from many valedictory debates that we have had in years gone by. Those two women, who I will come on to say something about, inspired many of the other women who spoke today. That was a real theme of the debate.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/5\">My right hon. and learned Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Harriet Harman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10260\">the Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman)</phrase> sends her apologies: she cannot be here for the wind-ups, and wants it noted that she had a bit of an accident with an out-of-control buggy when she was on granny duty. She is fit and strong, but she had to leave to get more painkillers for her shoulders. She really has been an exemplary Member of Parliament&#8212;the Mother of the House, and political mother to many of us. She really did create a path for many of us to follow.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/6\">It was also a real privilege to be here for the last speech by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Theresa May\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10426\">the right hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs May)</phrase>, another fantastic sister to all of us who has been a voice for the voiceless. She leaves an amazing track record that she can be proud of. Her words about democracy and respect for democracy were ones that we will all cherish.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/7\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Barry Sheerman\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10534\">the Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman)</phrase> is not in his place, though it does not really matter if people are not in their place any more, because there is no sanction. Right to the last, he was the enthusiastic, bobbing Back Bencher who was always there, although he is not there now. He was here every day, for most oral statements and questions, and we shall miss him.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/8\">A lot of people are not here, actually. We all recognise that <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ben Wallace\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/11668\">the right hon. Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace)</phrase> was an exemplary Defence Secretary in very difficult times, and the whole country felt a great deal of confidence in him.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/9\">My right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Margaret Hodge\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10281\">the Member for Barking (Dame Margaret Hodge)</phrase>, who is in her place, has had a long career, but she has always been feared and revered, and respected, in equal measure. Tax avoiders and money launderers take note: she is not going very far. She is a real example of joint working on a cross-party consensus.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/10\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matthew Hancock\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24773\">The right hon. Member for West Suffolk (Matt Hancock)</phrase> will always have a very long-lasting legacy with the public as the Health Secretary during covid, there on our televisions every evening providing that reassurance. I wish him well with his future career.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/11\">This is a very sad, emotional day for <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Blackford\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25361\">the right hon. Member for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Ian Blackford)</phrase>. It is very sad day for all of us because, although it might be a low bar, as I am sure the whole House can agree, he is definitely the most popular Member of this House from the Scottish National party. [Laughter.] We all wish him really well in the future.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/12\">My dear friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Robert Halfon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24784\">the right hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon)</phrase> has been a great campaigner, a great parliamentarian and a good friend, and has a really strong track record on education. Together with <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Andrew Percy\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24832\">the hon. Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy)</phrase>, the three of us did our best to try to get this House to agree to Common Market 2.0 and take a slightly more sensible approach to Brexit. I regard them both as friends, and I know that this House will be all the poorer without them here.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/13\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Stewart\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24907\">The right hon. Member for Beckenham (Bob Stewart)</phrase> was brilliantly brief and very funny in his remarks.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/14\">What a wonderful speech <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jo Churchill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25408\">the hon. Member for Bury St Edmunds (Jo Churchill)</phrase> gave. It was very funny and moving, and I completely agree with her that family is everything.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/15\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alok Sharma\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24902\">The right hon. Member for Reading West (Sir Alok Sharma)</phrase> will forever be known as the President of COP26, when the whole world was watching. He did that job absolutely brilliantly and has a strong track record to take with him.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/16\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tracey Crouch\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24871\">The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Dame Tracey Crouch)</phrase> and I are both in our 50th year&#8212;she is not here either, because she has family duties. I have immensely enjoyed working with her over the years, especially on football.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/17\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chloe Smith\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24691\">The right hon. Member for Norwich North (Chloe Smith)</phrase> is another strong woman who succeeded both in her career and in motherhood. She is a great inspiration.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/18\">In one short term, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Nickie Aiken\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25817\">the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Nickie Aiken)</phrase>, another friend of mine, has achieved a great deal. I have enjoyed working closely with her on the House of Commons Commission, and I wish her well.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/19\">What a typically funny, inspiring, thoughtful and informative speech <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Bob Neill\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/13736\">the hon. and learned Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Sir Robert Neill)</phrase> gave. He will long be known for all his work on justice, and I am sure he will be back in other guises.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/20\">To <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"David Jones\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/11506\">the right hon. Member for Clwyd West (Mr Jones)</phrase>: what fantastic service you have provided to Wales. I wish you well; or rather, I wish him well&#8212;if <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Eleanor Laing\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10348\">the right hon. Member for Epping Forest (Dame Eleanor Laing)</phrase> was here, she would tell me off.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/21\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Hammond\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/11927\">The hon. Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond)</phrase> is another popular Member of this House&#8212;so many popular Members are going. He reminded us of the importance of the constituency work we do&#8212;although he might want to have a conversation with the hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster behind him about other people doing that constituency work for him.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/22\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Tim Loughton\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10371\">The hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton)</phrase> is another Member who I have worked with, on early years and the importance of the first 1,001 days. I have really enjoyed the naughty corner, which he talked about, over these last few years. It will be much depleted after today, although I am not sure that I will follow his advice and try to make myself look like Quentin Letts. That might be a step too far.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/23\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Mark Menzies\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24804\">The hon. Member for Fylde (Mark Menzies)</phrase> and I have been friends for a number of years. I know that it has been a difficult year for him, but I am sure we can all wish him well for the future.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/24\">I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Robin Walker\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24862\">the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Walker)</phrase> for also being brief&#8212;I think we all enjoyed that&#8212;and for his passion for education and the work he has done as a Minister and as Chair of the Education Committee. I think we can all most definitely take his advice about screen time.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/25\"><phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Dehenna Davison\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25815\">The hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Dehenna Davison)</phrase>, who is not in her place either, might be relatively young, but I think we can all agree that she has made a real impact during her time in the House of Commons.</p><p pid=\"a1261.1/26\">What a proud record <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Will Quince\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25403\">the hon.

Member for Warrington South (Andy Carter)</phrase> and I have worked together on a number of issues, and I know that broadcasters and those in the media will miss him greatly in this place. As my husband works in Warrington Hospital, the hon.

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"a999.0/1\">I thank <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Helen Morgan\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/26056\">the hon. Member for North Shropshire (Helen Morgan)</phrase> for instigating this debate. I am only sad not to see <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jim Shannon\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/13864\">the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)</phrase> in his place&#8212;this may be the final Adjournment debate of the Session, and I feel personally hurt that he has not been here to intervene and to give Strangford&#8217;s take on Shropshire. However, I am sure he is somewhere thinking of us and kicking himself that he is not here.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/2\">The hon. Member for North Shropshire was right to say that all politics is local. She is also right to echo something that I have said on many occasions: most people&#8217;s exposure in our communities is to the facilities and services provided by local councils for their communities. We agree absolutely on that. I want to place on the record my thanks to all the councillors and officers of Shropshire Council, and indeed to local government across the country, for all that they do and strive to do. They get out of bed in the morning to achieve for their communities, to deliver change, to make place and to improve opportunities and living.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/3\">The hon. Lady referred specifically to libraries. Libraries is a topic very close to my heart, both as a keen reader and, as a child, an avid attender of our local library. Dorset Council has done the most phenomenal work with its libraries in similarly challenging circumstances, being a rural council and the like. I am pretty certain that should her officers in Shropshire reach out to those in Dorset, they would be happy to provide some advice or guidance&#8212;call it what you will&#8212;on safeguarding the future delivery of those important services.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/4\">The hon. Lady is right that I have acknowledged&#8212;the Government have acknowledged&#8212;the challenging financial circumstances of local government, brought about in whole, or certainly in very great part, by pressures on adult social care, special educational needs and disabilities, and home-to-school transport. Around about 80% of an upper-tier council&#8217;s budget is spent on 10% to 15% of its population. We just have to watch that balance to ensure that council tax payers feel that they are getting something for their money. As she will know, I have not  committed on behalf of the Government to a root-and-branch review of the local government funding formula, because my assessment is that it is all but broken&#8212;an analogue proposal for a digital age that needs reworking from the bottom up. I have always asked for certainty and clarity from the local government sector, and as a Government, we have always been keen to deliver them. In the next Parliament, they could best be delivered by having, in the short term, a multi-year settlement to give that security, and then by Parliament using that time&#8212;and I cannot overstate the value that I see in this&#8212;to provide a cross-party sustainable solution for delivering on these issues.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/5\">I do not say this flippantly, because I have thought about it, but the hon. Lady has spoken in this Chamber and in Westminster Hall about local government finance and local government issues more generally, and I have answered on many occasions her questions and those of Labour Members, and it suddenly struck me early this morning&#8212;I do not know why it struck me then&#8212;that although they may identify a problem, I have yet to hear their solution. I have yet to hear the genesis of an idea from the Opposition parties. The Labour party has had 14 years to think about it, and the hon. Lady&#8217;s party has had the past nine years, but there is absolutely no idea. She told us&#8212;I jotted down her words contemporaneously &#8212;that we need to give consideration to</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a999.0/6\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;how we fund social care, and indeed how we collect council tax.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a999.0/7\">I agree with her, but she gave no suggested solution to those pressing problems. I find that very strange given that Opposition parties really have nothing else to do than beaver away on policy to put before the electorate in just a few weeks&#8217; time.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/8\">Although the hon. Lady was right to point out that she has no idea, and no more do I, of what the result of the election will be, it is very much my hope that I may be standing at the Government Dispatch Box setting out the plans to which we have committed on the fundamental review and rewriting of local government finance. I shall leave that to the electorate of North Dorset to decide, and I hope that they put their faith and trust in me, as they have done on the past several occasions.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/9\">Let me turn briefly to some of the figures. I have said them so many times now that I get slightly bored of them, but I think it worthwhile to read them into the record. The local government finance settlement for 2024-25 makes available up to &#163;64.7 billion&#8212;an increase in core spending power of up to &#163;4.5 billion, or 7.5% in cash terms, compared with 2023-24. We listened to the views of local government, and many colleagues from across the House, including the hon. Lady, who knows how grateful I was that she took part in the parliamentary level of the consultation that I undertook, which was the highest level of take-up that a Minister has delivered. As a result of listening to what we heard, the Government announced additional measures for local authorities in England worth a further &#163;600 million, including &#163;500 million of new funding for councils with responsibility for adult and children&#8217;s social care.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/10\">What does that represent as far as the hon. Lady&#8217;s council is concerned? The settlement represents an increase in core spending power of up to &#163;25.1 million, or 8%, making available a whopping total of &#163;340.2 million in 2024-25. That is not small beer for Shropshire Council. I also recognise, as the hon. Lady does, the additional  cost pressures and challenges of delivering quality services in a rural environment with a sparse population and longer travel times, which is why we have set such enormous store by the rural services delivery grant. As she knows, because Shropshire ranks within the top 25 sparsely populated areas in England, her council received an additional &#163;9 million through the RSDG for 2024-25 on top of the other moneys I have spoken of, in order to assist with the importance and the difficulties of serving dispersed populations.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/11\">Is it enough&#8212;is it ever enough? Who knows? We always need more. It is important that every year, councils take the opportunity to learn from others, peer review, and engage the Local Government Association to help them modernise and seek savings through shared services and other initiatives. I know that many councils do that, but not all do. As we know, Shropshire went unitary and gleaned a huge amount of financial benefit from so doing, as did my council area of Dorset. There are things that local authorities can be doing to reduce expenditure and to use the money from the savings they make to continue to deliver those services that, increasingly, people look to their local council to deliver.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/12\">In conclusion, I am grateful to the hon. Member for North Shropshire for raising this issue. She and I share many things, including a concern for making sure that our rural areas are well represented in this place. I will continue to do that on behalf of my constituents; I hope the hon. Lady will not take it ill if I say that I hope my party will represent North Shropshire after the general election, but it has been a personal pleasure to work alongside her over these past several months since I have been dealing with local government. She has brought a lot of engagement to the process. I am just sorry that her party has not brought forward any ideas, but let us share those ideas cross-party in the next Parliament to ensure we have a robust settlement rubric that will meet demands: one that will be cost-effective and affordable, but will continue to deliver the quality of public services that so many in our communities rely upon and rightly deserve.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/13\">Question put and agreed to.</p><p pid=\"a999.0/14\">House adjourned.</p>',\n",

I hope they will look with kindness on what has been said by my right hon. Friend the Minister, although there are other interpretations in respect of a number of issues.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/3\">Those who think there should be a memorial do not necessarily think the learning centre should be with it, while those who think there should be a learning centre do not think it should be squashed into what I described as a box under a memorial. There are many who think that the memorial could be better than the design that was not chosen in Ottawa, and I think it is a continuing embarrassment to the Government that the name of the person who was mentioned 13 times in the announcement of the winning design, Sir David Adjaye, is one that Ministers cannot say today.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/4\">I refer Members to the transcript of the Select Committee hearing on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">5 February</phrase>. Let me quote from paragraph 25:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Many people will know Sir David Adjaye&#8217;s statement that &#8216;disrupting the pleasure of being in a park is key to the thinking&#8217;, but fewer people have heard the first part of that quote which is, &#8216;We have the opportunity to activate the entire site&#8217;&#8221;,</p><p pid=\"a984.1/6\">or what he had said previously:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;&#8216;There has been a kind of picture painted that this is a public garden...It moves from being just a kind of public park to being much more ceremonial, much more kind of ordered&#8217;.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/8\">I could also quote from paragraphs 26 and 27, but I will not do so. However, I will quote from paragraph 58, which states that if the learning centre is built,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/9\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;the playground is actually going to be reduced by 370 square metres. That is by 31%, not about 15% as noticed and remarked on by the inspector, or 10% in the figures given by Baroness Scott&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/10\">&#8212;the Minister in the House of Lords&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;in her 2023 parliamentary answer, or even zero reduction, as stated by David Adjaye, misleadingly&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/12\">&#8212;I would say &#8220;mistakenly&#8221;&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a984.1/13\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;to the inquiry. A 31% loss cannot possibly be said to be an enhancement or a reconfiguration of the playground. That is what Chris Pincher, then briefly Minister of State, said in support of his 2021 planning permission approval for this project.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a984.1/14\">I refer Members to a book by Dorian Gerhold, &#8220;Victoria Tower Gardens&#8221;, which is subtitled &#8220;The prehistory, creation and planned destruction of a London park&#8221;. What we are talking about here is not particularly the memorial&#8212;having a good memorial would be better than having a bad memorial&#8212;but Victoria Tower Gardens. We have this legislation because the Government did not care about the 1900 Act.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/15\">I say to the Government that better faith would have been acknowledging that the Bill they were putting forward was hybrid, without resisting that fact to the examiners in both Houses. We now pass the Bill on the  House of Lords, where I believe that people will look again, with fresh eyes and fair eyes, at how we can commemorate those who died but do the best we can to educate people so that what happened is less likely to happen again.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/16\">The idea that a particular memorial will stop it happening would be laughed at by those who are commemorating and mourning the Yazidi genocide 10 years ago, the Rwandan genocide, and one or two others I could name in other parts of the world. We have to do what is right.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/17\">Let me end by saying this. My first cousin once removed was one of the Westminster Medical School students who went into Bergen-Belsen and were able to saves the lives of about half the people who were existing there at the time. I have worked with people Holocaust survivors, and I believe that we do best by doing what is right in a good way, which is why I welcome what <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Matthew Pennycook\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25379\">the hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Matthew Pennycook)</phrase> said about the normal planning process. As my right hon. Friend the Minister said and as Christopher Katkowski has said, the normal planning process will happen.</p><p pid=\"a984.1/18\">Let us look forward&#8212;if the Bill is carried over&#8212;to a planning process in which an application is made to the local authority, and the local authority makes the decision. If the authority approves the application, there is no problem; if it does not, the Minister can call it in, but the Minister should not call it in before Westminster City Council has had a chance to see any revised proposals that the Government can now put forward.</p>',\n",

Friend is right, and most people will agree with him, even if their job is to stand up and say something different.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/2\">I will not spend much time on the planning permission, because it is not the subject of the Bill. When the inspector&#8217;s report was received by the Government and considered, this was the conclusion under the signature of the planning casework unit:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/3\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;This decision was made by the Minister of State for Housing in line with the published handling arrangements for this case&#8230;and signed on his behalf. In particular, those handling arrangements state that:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/4\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8216;Christopher Pincher MP (the Housing and Planning Minister) will be responsible for exercising the functions of the Secretary of State under sections 70 and 77 of the Town and Country Planning Act&#8217;&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a938.1/5\">and so on. Who here believes that a Minister of State would, on merit, turn down an application by their own Secretary of State? I will give way to anybody who wants to make that suggestion. It is just incredible. It would not happen.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/6\">I will now change tone a bit. During the Select Committee hearings, the Government counsel suddenly switched from saying who the lead designer and architect for the proposal was. The Government&#8217;s press notice announcing the winner contained 13 references to Sir David Adjaye, now Order of Merit, four references to Ron Arad, and no references to Asa Bruno. Proper tribute  has been paid to Asa Bruno. It is true that he was the one who put a number of points to the inspector. He is recognised as a leading designer, and his obituary, which I refreshed my mind on just now, showed that he was a startlingly good person. However, when the Government announced the lead designer and architect for the proposal, they named Sir David Adjaye, who could hardly be mentioned by the promoters at the Select Committee for reasons that I will not go into now. They are well known and in the public domain.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/7\">Let us turn to the points that the Government made to the Select Committee after I raised that issue:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/8\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">24 January</phrase>, in a debate on the Business of the House (col 439), Sir Peter Bottomley MP referred to the proceedings at the seventh public session of the Holocaust Memorial Bill committee and suggested that counsel for the Promoter may have &#8216;inadvertently told the committee things that are contradicted by the facts&#8230;&#8217; in relation to responsibilities for the design of the Memorial.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a938.1/9\">I was then told that what was said was right. I think that that leading counsel, over and over again, was trying to write Sir David Adjaye out because of the embarrassment to Government. If it was Asa Bruno who was responsible for the Ottawa proposal, so be it, but that was not what Government said seven years ago in public.</p><p pid=\"a938.1/10\">I am going to go on fighting this, but not so long this evening, because my colleagues have more to say. I say to those watching the proceedings, &#8220;Look into the details of what has happened.&#8221; I commend to them early-day motions 711, tabled on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 May</phrase>, and 775, tabled on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">21 May</phrase>. In particular, the latter &#8220;regrets that the promoter&#8221; &#8212;that is, the Government&#8212;</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a938.1/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;has failed to understand the justified requests for a detailed comparison of the present unsatisfactory scheme with the alternatives studied by the Government&#8217;s consultants; further regrets the continuing lack of updated costings for capital and recurrent costs; disagrees with the suggestion that planning permission and all other necessary consents were obtained in the usual way; regrets there is no known plan to spend more available resources on education rather than on construction; further regrets that known and growing security restrictions are not being adequately addressed; and believes the promoter is not meeting its obligation to achieve an appropriate memorial at a justified cost in a suitable location, associated with opportunities to learn and to understand the Holocaust and to reduce the likelihood of a repeat of the atrocities of the Holocaust.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a938.1/12\">I end with words from the Holocaust survivors who gave evidence at the Committee, who said, in summary, that the proposal is too big for the gardens and too small for its purpose.</p>',\n",

The aim of Prevent is to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting terrorism. It also extends to supporting the rehabilitation and disengagement of those already involved in terrorism.

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"a849.3/1\">My hon. Friend is absolutely right to talk about awareness and understanding, and the role of communication in that. I will speak a little more about communication, but there is always more that we will need to do. Of course, I would also be happy to continue the conversation with her about how best we do it.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/2\">The guidance makes it clear that schools should ensure that they are aware of any pupils with allergies, and should have processes in place to ensure that the allergies can be well managed. Practices to identify children with such needs could include wristbands, or, as my hon. Friend said, having a photograph of the child alongside details of their allergy in the kitchen or serving area of the school. I stress again that individual schools are best placed to work with parents to put in place the most effective responsive system.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/3\">In addition to the section 100 duty, schools are subject to other requirements. In the UK, food businesses must inform consumers if they use any of the 14 mandatory allergens as ingredients in their food. How allergen  information should be provided depends on whether the food is prepacked, non-prepacked or prepacked for direct sale. This includes food provided by institutions such as school caterers, who have a responsibility to protect the people in their care. As colleagues may know, rules on the provision of food labelling are set out primarily in the retained 2014 regulations, and these include a requirement to identify the presence of any of those 14 mandatory allergens to consumers.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/4\">The Department for Education also works closely with the Food Standards Agency, which provides free food allergy and intolerance training online. This offers practical advice to local authority law enforcement officers and anyone wanting to learn more about food allergies, such as those working in the food manufacturing and catering industries. The FSA also offers a whole host of other training, technical documents and guidance.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/5\">Turning to auto-injectors, these can be vital when a child is suffering an allergic reaction. To support schools in meeting the needs of children with allergies, the Government passed the Human Medicines (Amendment) Regulations 2017, which allow schools to obtain and hold spare adrenaline auto-injectors for administration to pupils in an emergency. The Department for Health and Social Care has produced guidance on the use of adrenaline auto-injectors and emergency inhalers in schools, including the purchase of spares. The guidance makes it clear that any adrenalin auto-injectors held by a school should be considered a back-up device, rather than a replacement for a pupil&#8217;s own adrenalin auto-injector.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/6\">Beyond this, families have a vital role to play in managing their child&#8217;s condition. We are very clear with schools that no one will know a child&#8217;s needs as well as their parents, and that schools should work closely with parents. The parents of children with allergies will work with medical professionals and other organisations to plan for and navigate their child&#8217;s specific needs. Parents should be fully consulted and engaged in any discussions relating to their child&#8217;s allergy.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/7\">Schools will also need to ensure that the parents or carers of children with food allergies or intolerances are given information about the allergenic ingredients used in the foods available. Good communication between parents and schools on allergies and pupils&#8217; needs is essential to keep children safe while in school.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/8\">My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton referred to the role of Ofsted, further to the points made by the hon. Member for Strangford, and the importance of schools having a clear allergies policy and involving parents in discussions about the needs of their children. Ofsted inspectors gather a wide range of evidence to make their judgments, and evaluate the experience of individuals or groups of individuals, which can include the experiences of pupils with medical needs, if the issue is raised by parents or pupils. In an inspection, inspectors will assess the effectiveness of safeguarding at the school, which includes the extent to which pupils with specific needs and vulnerabilities are kept safe. The safeguarding culture is also explored by speaking to leaders and staff about their work and the messages that pupils receive through the curriculum.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/9\">During last November&#8217;s Westminster Hall debate on pupils with allergies, my hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton informed the House that she would write to all schools in her constituency to ask them to adopt the voluntary schools allergy code, co-created by  the Benedict Blythe Foundation, the Independent Schools Bursars Association and the allergy team. Taking her lead, Ministers in the Department for Education instructed officials to share a link to the code in our fortnightly email bulletin to schools issued on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 March</phrase>. That communication also reminded school leaders of their duties concerning pupils with allergies.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/10\">For younger children, the early years foundation stage framework sets the standards that all registered early years providers must meet for the learning, development and care of children from birth to age five. The EYFS states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a849.3/11\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Before a child is admitted to the setting, you must obtain information about any special dietary requirements, preferences and food allergies that the child has, and any special health requirements.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a849.3/12\">Providers must have a policy and procedures for administering medicines, and they must have systems for obtaining information about a child&#8217;s medicine needs and for keeping this information up to date. Training must be provided for staff where the administering of medicine requires medical or technical knowledge.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/13\">Within all early years settings, there is a requirement for at least one person with a current paediatric first aid certificate to be on the premises and available at all times when children are present, and they must accompany children on outings. The PFA criteria are clear that the training should include being able to help a baby or child who is suffering from anaphylactic shock.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/14\">Last September, we changed the adequate supervision requirement in the early years foundation stage to be explicit that adequate supervision while children are eating meals means that children must always be in sight and hearing of an adult, rather than within sight or hearing. This will help practitioners to see the signs of an allergic reaction as soon as they are present, and it will allow them to act quickly.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/15\">The new early years educator level 3 qualification criteria will also come into force in September, ensuring that early years practitioners have an understanding of allergies and anaphylaxis. In April 2024, the Department published nutrition content on the &#8220;help for early years providers&#8221; online platform. The content includes a section on allergies and anaphylaxis to help early years providers prevent allergic reactions, to recognise the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylactic shock, and to know what to do if they occur.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/16\">On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">22 April</phrase>, the Department launched a consultation on the safeguarding requirements in the EYFS. One of the proposals is the inclusion of a safer eating section, which includes requirements for all staff to be aware of  the symptoms and treatments for allergies and anaphylaxis, and to obtain allergy action plans for children with allergies. We plan to publish our response to that consultation in the autumn.</p><p pid=\"a849.3/17\">I have outlined the various pieces of legislation and guidance that cover allergies in school. Given the complexity and individual nature of food allergies, the Government&#8217;s view is that it would not be appropriate for the Department for Education to legislate for food providers to cater for all requirements. However, through legislation, the minimum standards for school food have been clearly set out. Beyond that, headteachers, school governors and their caterers are best placed to make decisions about their school food policies that take into account local circumstances.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"a807.2/1\">There are certainly lessons to be learned for the UK: not to have a Tory Government. If we had a Labour Government, things would be in a much better position. I am sure the hon. Gentleman will be encouraging all his constituents to vote Labour at the general election in order to make that change.</p><p pid=\"a807.2/2\">My fourth question to the Minister is that the fiscal framework of August 2023 suggests that these figures will be increased by inflation from 2024-25 onwards. Will the Minister confirm that is correct? What inflationary measure will be used to do that? Every household in Scotland, and up and down the UK, knows the impact the current Government have had on borrowing overall. Crashing the economy and trebling the national debt has had consequences for everyone. The interest payments on Government debt alone as a share of the economy are now the highest since in early 1950s.</p><p pid=\"a807.2/3\">Thanks to the former Prime Minister&#8217;s disastrous premiership, interest rates that homeowners are now paying have gone through the roof, taking away home ownership for many in this country. We are in the midst of a cost of living crisis that was made in Downing Street but is being paid for by working people all over the country. If it is possible to sum up this dreadful Government in one individual&#8217;s actions and behaviours, it is the crashing of the economy, accompanied by the highest tax burden on working people in 70 years, and the largest fall in living standards since records began in the 1950s. They are reckless, incompetent and unapologetic for the chaos they have wrought across the country.</p><p pid=\"a807.2/4\">But the Government seem to want to go further. They have looked at the former Prime Minister&#8217;s chaos inflicted on the country by the &#163;45 billion unfunded tax cuts for the richest, and decided to trump that with a &#163;46 billion unfunded tax cut to scrap national insurance, but will not tell us how they will pay for it. [Interruption.] There is chuntering from the Treasury Bench. Instead of chuntering, perhaps they will tell us how they will pay for that &#163;46 billion unfunded commitment. When the Minister responds, will he take the opportunity of this rare occasion of a Scottish statutory instrument being discussed on the Floor of the House to answer my fifth question, about where the money for the &#163;46 billion unfunded commitment will come from?</p><p pid=\"a807.2/5\">We have had three failed Prime Ministers in the UK over as many years, an embarrassing statistic the SNP could not help but match, with three First Ministers in Scotland in as many years. They have brought back former leaders to take charge, although the party in government in this Parliament have not done that for the top job, or certainly not for now anyway. Scotland is governed by a man who is responsible for many of the problems we face in the first place&#8212;he will have to take charge of these borrowing requirements&#8212;the Education Secretary who wrecked our education system, the Finance Secretary who decimated local government finance and the leader who led them to their worst ever election result.</p>',\n",

The broader point he is also making is that schools must have that support, because it is a part of how they can tackle absence in schools. That is why we need to tackle this issue head-on and not let it spiral further out of control.</p><p pid=\"a591.1/2\">Children are not engaging with the curriculum and assessment system, which has been described to us &#8212;I also speak on behalf of the shadow schools Minister, my hon.

The UK now has the second lowest average life satisfaction of 15-year-olds in the OECD. Opportunities for music, art, sport and drama, as well as for discussion and debate, are often squeezed. Our curriculum and assessment review would look at delivering a broad curriculum that prepares children for the future, reflecting children&#8217;s desire for learning, as well as reflecting issues and diversity in our society.</p><p pid=\"a591.1/3\">Children&#8217;s early speech and language development has also suffered over the past few years, and covid contributed other stresses and anxieties. Getting it right at an early stage will lead to better engagement throughout school life. We would equip primary schools with funds to deliver evidence-based early language interventions. Finally, we would introduce a &#8220;children not in school&#8221; register to ensure that children who are not being taught in a school environment do not fall through the gaps.</p><p pid=\"a591.1/4\">Today&#8217;s Bill is extremely important and I again congratulate the right hon. Member for Chelmsford. I wish it well as it moves through the other place, but it is important to acknowledge that it shines a spotlight on the Government&#8217;s lack of action to deal with the crisis in our schools. Significantly, that was highlighted by Sir Kevan Collins when he resigned as education recovery commissioner in 2021. In describing the Government&#8217;s catch-up plan as &#8220;feeble&#8221;, he highlighted how there was not the intervention that we need to secure our children&#8217;s future effectively. That is why we need much more urgent action from Ministers on how they intend to tackle this problem. Tinkering around the edges simply will not do. We need a proper long-term plan, and if the Government will not deliver it, despite the right hon. Lady&#8217;s best efforts, the next Labour Government will do so.</p>',\n",

Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Preet Kaur Gill)</phrase> on securing this evening&#8217;s debate. Let me start by providing some national context before answering some of her questions. She mentioned a number of crime figures in her speech, and it is important to put on record that two sets of crime statistics are published: there is police recorded crime, which are the figures she is quoting, and then there is the crime survey for England and Wales produced by the Office for National Statistics. The police recorded crime figures depend on the propensity of the public to report and how good a job the police do in recording those crimes. Over the last five or seven years, the police have become a lot better at recording all the crimes reported to them, and that is why those numbers have gone up.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/2\">However, the Office for National Statistics tells us that the most reliable set of figures for long-term crime trends are not the police reported crimes figures for the reasons I have set out&#8212;they depend on the public&#8217;s propensity to report and the police&#8217;s ability to record them&#8212;but the crime survey. Let me give the hon. Lady some of the crime survey figures since 2010, which she mentioned as a reference period. On a like-for-like basis, all crime has come down by 54% since 2010, according to the independent Office for National Statistics, while violence is down by 46%, theft by 47%, domestic burglary by 55%, and vehicle theft by 39%. There is a lot more to do, particularly on shoplifting, vehicle crime and knife crime, which I will come to in a moment, but the overall crime trends are down.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/3\">On resources, which the hon. Lady mentioned a few times, across England and Wales as a whole, we now have record numbers of police officers. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">31 March</phrase> last year, we reached 149,566 police officers. That is more than we have ever had before, and it surpasses the previous peak, which was in March 2010, by about 3,500 officers. So we have record police numbers, and those have broadly speaking been maintained since that record was reached in March last year.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/4\">On West Midlands police specifically, its budget this year was &#163;790 million, which is an increase of &#163;51 million year on year, or about 6.4%&#8212;considerably higher than the current rate of inflation. I think many of the questions the hon. Lady is asking are questions she should be addressing to Simon Foster, the police and crime commissioner for the West Midlands, who somehow managed to get re-elected a couple of weeks ago, because he has those financial resources. Whereas other police areas around the country have hit record numbers, as has the total, that has not happened in the West Midlands. That is a question I would strongly encourage her to ask Mr Foster, now that he has somehow got himself re-elected.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/5\">The hon. Lady asked several questions about specific crime types. She went through quite a long list, so I will quickly go through some of the more important of  them. She mentioned, for example, knife crime, which is a concern. The number of people getting admitted to hospital with an injury by a knife has come down by 26% in the last five years, but there is further to go. London is conspicuously much worse than the rest of the country. In the rest of the country, a lot more progress is being made, but there is an exception in London.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/6\">We are doing quite a lot to combat this. First, we are encouraging a greater use of stop and search&#8212;done respectfully, of course. That takes knives off the streets, and we would welcome cross-party support for the police to lawfully use stop and search more to get dangerous knives off the street. Secondly, we are investing in various forms of technology. In fact, just this lunch time I was with a company&#8212;an American company&#8212;that is developing a new technology that can scan somebody walking down a street to see whether they are carrying a knife, and it can distinguish a knife from a mobile phone or something else. It is not quite ready to deploy yet, but I think it will be ready to deploy experimentally this year. I think that could revolutionise our ability to look at a crowd and detect who in that crowd is carrying a knife, and then make sure they are stopped, the knife is taken off them and they are arrested.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/7\">We are also doing quite a lot of work on prevention, and the hon. Lady mentioned youth services. Notoriously, Birmingham City Council went bankrupt, but the Home Office is directly funding violence reduction units, to the tune of more than &#163;50 million a year across the country, which are designed to work with young people&#8212;whether it is with mentoring, work experience, cognitive behavioural therapy or youth activities, sometimes in partnership with football clubs&#8212;to help get them on to a better path.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/8\">The Youth Endowment Fund does lots of work here&#8212;it has &#163;200 million&#8212;and I commend the work of Jon Yates, the chief executive. From next year, there is going to be a &#163;75 million increase in violence reduction unit funding over three years, which is about a 50% increase because, as the hon. Lady says, supporting those young people is so important. This autumn, we will also be piloting, with the Youth Endowment Fund, a new initiative to try to identify the 50 or so of young people or early teenagers who are most at risk of getting into serious violence and serious crime. That includes looking at a range of indicators, such as mental health, education, housing or having an older sibling who is involved in a gang&#8212;indicators that go beyond criminal justice, so that interventions can be made to stop a vulnerable or at-risk 12 or 13-year-old becoming a violent 17 or 18-year-old. That initiative has the potential to make a real difference.</p><p pid=\"c234.0/9\">The hon. Lady talked about car crime, and crime more widely, which is a concern. I recently met the chief executive of Jaguar Land Rover to discuss exactly this point. We are stepping up work on car crime, and are working with the National Police Chiefs&#8217; Council lead, Assistant Chief Constable Jenny Sims of the Merseyside force. Stolen cars are often sold and rapidly exported in containers to countries including the United Arab Emirates and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. We will do more work to stop that export at the border. We will also increase the amount of intelligence work done, so that we can spot patterns and identify the organised criminal gangs who are often stealing these cars.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"b750.1/1\">I congratulate my Durham colleague, my hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Grahame Morris\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24715\">the Member for Easington (Grahame Morris)</phrase>, on securing this afternoon&#8217;s important debate. For the last 23 years, I have had the privilege of representing North Durham, which was part of the once mighty Durham coalfield. Over those 23 years, I have seen many changes.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/2\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Ian Lavery\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24963\">the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery)</phrase> spoke about the close-knit tradition of mining communities&#8212;not just in County Durham, but in his own area in Northumberland. Having grown up as the  son of a miner, I am familiar with that close-knit tradition and the reliability of work that there was in such communities. However, I do not look at the past through rose-tinted spectacles, because, to use a Hobbesian phrase, life was nasty, brutish and short for many people. There was nothing romantic about the death rates, which we just accepted as the price of coal, but many of the communities in my constituency&#8212;the town of Stanley, for example&#8212;were built on coal. The surrounding villages, such as Craghead, Sacriston and others, were all built because of coalmining. Their economic existence was coalmining. When that was finally taken away in 1985, when the last pits closed, the economic heart was ripped out of those communities overnight, as has been mentioned by many hon. Members who have contributed to today&#8217;s debate.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/3\">Today, people would not recognise where the mining industry was based in North Durham unless they know the history of the area. They would certainly not know where the pit was in the South Yorkshire village where I grew up if they did not know the history of that village. That unseen legacy has cast a long shadow over many mining communities. I congratulate the Coalfields Regeneration Trust on its excellent report on the state of coalfield communities in 2020. It is a superb piece  of work.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/4\">When I was first elected, the legacy of heavy industry, and certainly coalmining, was evident in my constituency. People who had worked underground their whole life suffered from not only debilitating lung disease, but other physical conditions related to heavy industry. Sadly, that generation is increasingly no longer with us.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/5\">After that social fabric was taken out of County Durham, we had unemployment, deprivation and poverty and, as happens in many communities, crime and drugs filled the gap. When I was first elected, I described North Durham as a rural constituency with urban problems and, as in the constituencies of my hon. Friends the Members for Easington and for Wansbeck, the legacy of drug abuse, for example, is still there today. This health inequality is now affecting a lost generation of younger people born in the 1980s, some now in their 40s, who never got into proper paid employment.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/6\">The report from the Coalfields Regeneration Trust speaks for itself. Life expectancy in coalfield communities is 82 for women, as opposed to 85 in the south-east of England, and 78 for men, as opposed to 81 in the south-east of England. The other thing that appals me&#8212;I have spoken about this before, and I feel very passionately about it&#8212;is that, in a wealthy country, life expectancy in County Durham has gone down over the last 10 years, which is an absolute disgrace. The report also outlines that, in 2021, the proportion of the population reporting bad or very bad health was 7.1% in former coalfield areas, compared with 4.2% in the south-east of England and 4.3% in London.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/7\">We have a legacy of ill health. Health professionals in County Durham tell me that the age at which people access intensive healthcare is now in their mid-to-late 50s. That puts extra pressure on our health services, which is not reflected in the funding. In addition, my constituency is now in the commuter belt for Tyneside and other areas, which is very difficult for people in many outlying communities unless they have access to a car. Young people do not have aspiration, which is  difficult to raise, to get into good, well-paid employment. Warehousing and other low-skilled or semi-skilled work are no replacement for the high-quality jobs that we used to have in the coalfields.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/8\">We have heard a lot of talk from the Government about levelling up. I have said it before and will say it again: levelling up is a complete con. It is not a serious measure to level up Britain. If it were, the communities highlighted by the report would be at the top of the list. It is all about capital projects and pork barrel politics, basically setting areas against one another. Councils have spent millions of pounds, certainly in County Durham&#8217;s case, submitting bids that were never going to succeed. The only successful bid from County Durham was in Bishop Auckland, which happened to have a Conservative Member of Parliament, getting half a bypass in the process.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/9\">Levelling up has not replaced the &#163;240 million that the Government have taken out of Durham County Council&#8217;s core funding by shifting the tax base on to local council tax payers. My hon. Friend the Member for Easington spoke about the low council tax base in County Durham, where 60% of properties are in band A, which means that we cannot raise money.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/10\">Additionally, we need extra services for our growing elderly population and our growing number of looked-after children. Is there a relationship between the closure of Sure Start centres, which offered early intervention for families, and the number of looked-after children who are coming back into care? It does not take a genius to work out that the two are related, and the Government have slowly woken up to that fact and are now reintroducing children&#8217;s centres.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/11\">We also had access to European regional development funding. Again, it was promised that no region would lose out, but we have. That money automatically came to areas like the north-east, and it did some fantastic work. It did not fixate on capital projects, at which the local Member of Parliament or whoever wanted to be elected could open a plaque; it was about employment and training. I worked with my hon. Friend the Member for Easington on DurhamWorks, which has been very good at getting young people who are not in education, employment or training back into work.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/12\">Levelling up has been a complete con, and we need that investment if we are to make a real change to health, employment and training. The Prime Minister let the cat out of the bag when he stood for the leadership of the Tory party and boasted that he would take money away from areas like mine and redistribute it to leafier parts of the south-east of England. That is exactly what has happened, and the idea that the Government can take the needs-based element out of this is absolutely disgraceful. The idea that they can give coalfield areas the odd &#163;20 million here and there to replace the hundreds of millions of pounds that they have lost in local government funding, ERDF funding and other funding is just a con.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/13\">I look back to the last Labour Government with clear eyes. County Durham had five new schools, three new health centres, a new hospital and two new further education colleges. That is real investment in a community. I am also proud that, in government, we paid compensation to people with COPD, which should have been done many years earlier. It took a Labour Government to do that.</p><p pid=\"b750.1/14\">We need a radical change of approach, which no one can foresee at the fag end of this Parliament. It will only happen with the election of a Labour Government who will reprioritise the needs of individuals. Without that, the legacy of limited employment opportunities and ill health in our coalmining communities will continue, not just for those who worked in the industry but for generations to come. In a wealthy country like Britain, it is a national scandal that we should leave such communities to suffer in this way.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"c641.1/1\">I will give the hon. Lady the courtesy of addressing new clause 7 in due course. She is right to highlight that the new rate for small businesses will keep around 70% of businesses in the country at 19% when those that are most profitable move to 25%, but look at the entire package of support for small businesses. It shows that the Government are supportive of our high streets and small business entrepreneurs across the country, whether that is through the increase in VAT thresholds, the 75% rate relief for retail, hospitality and leisure businesses, or all the support that we provided during the covid pandemic and throughout the energy shock, including the energy bill relief scheme and the energy bills support scheme. I put it to her that we are behind our small businesses. We regard them as the engine of our growth, and we will continue to do everything we can to support them. I will come on to new clause 7 in a moment, if I may.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/2\">New clause 3 would require a review of the possible impacts of the energy security investment mechanism on energy profits levy revenues, and on investment decisions in the oil and gas sector. It would require this assessment to be made on the basis of the end date of the EPL falling before the end of the next Parliament.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/3\">The Government have already published the tax information and impact note, which sets out the anticipated impact of the energy security investment mechanism&#8212;the ESIM. This indicates clearly that the mechanism will  give operators and lenders to the oil and gas industry confidence in the fiscal regime while the EPL remains over the next Parliament. Based on the OBR&#8217;s current price projections, the ESIM is not predicted to trigger before the end of the EPL in March 2029, and is therefore expected to have no impact on EPL revenues. In addition, should there be interest in calculating forgone revenue if the EPL were to end in a particular year, the OBR has published projected EPL revenues over the forecast period, and the impact of the EPL ending early can be calculated from this publicly available information that is there for all to see.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/4\">Regarding the assessment of the investment decisions within the oil and gas sector, the Government have been clear that they want oil and gas companies to reinvest their profits here in the United Kingdom, and by legislating for the ESIM we are giving these companies and their investors the confidence that if prices fall, the EPL will cease. This allows the sector to continue investing in the economy, in jobs and in UK energy security while ensuring fairness to the taxpayer, as I said earlier. Indeed, when the ESIM was first introduced, the Offshore Energies UK trade body agreed that the ESIM was a step in the right direction to support confidence and investment in the sector. However, it should be noted that there are of course commercial decisions to be made, and it is not possible for the Government to make an assessment of the impacts of the ESIM on the decisions of commercial organisations.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/5\">New clause 7 seeks the laying of a report before this House within three months, assessing the impact of clause 13 on how small and medium enterprises manage their costs. The introduction of the small profits rate last year kept the rate of corporation tax at 19% for companies with profits of less than &#163;50,000, and the availability of marginal relief means that companies with profits between &#163;50,000 and &#163;250,000 pay below the main rate of 25%. This ensures that companies have greater post-tax profits to reinvest, to distribute and to retain to cover future costs and any shocks in the economy. Clause 13 simply maintains this approach from April 2025 onwards, providing advance certainty to taxpayers.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/6\">More broadly, it should be noted that our corporation tax rules are based on the fundamental principle of taxing profits net of costs. HMRC already releases its corporation tax statistics publication annually, which breaks down data on corporation tax liabilities by the size of company. Once tax returns covering the period since the small profits rate was introduced come in, this will be reflected in the data, but I am afraid that that will not happen within the next three months.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/7\">My hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Christopher Chope\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10103\">the Member for Christchurch (Sir Christopher Chope)</phrase> made a typically colourful speech. He made some very valid points, with which many in the Committee will agree. We all want tax to come down. As I said to <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Sarah Olney\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25596\">the hon. Member for Richmond Park (Sarah Olney)</phrase>, we have included a provision and a rate to ensure that 70% of businesses&#8212;the smallest, least profitable businesses&#8212;maintain a rate of 19%. We had to increase the rate in the face of an incredibly challenging environment on the back of covid and the war in Ukraine, when the Government stepped in with significant support for businesses, families and individuals  across the country. I can tell my hon. Friend that the extension to 25% will raise &#163;85 billion, which will help to reduce our debt over the long term.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/8\">We have introduced full permanent expensing, as my hon. Friend mentioned, and I think it is fair to say that he was sceptical of that. However, it was called for directly and clearly by the CBI, Make UK and a number of businesses that want to reinvest their profits into other endeavours and into plant and machinery. I put it to him that we should be looking at the effective rate of taxation for a business, not just the headline rate, but that our headline rate for the largest, most profitable businesses is, at 25%, still the lowest in the G7, which is the most comparable mix of countries to look at.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/9\">Of course we want to see tax simplification in all our fiscal statements, which is why we decided to abolish multiple dwellings relief in our last fiscal event. It is also why the Chancellor has set out his long-term ambition to abolish national insurance contributions, which would simplify our tax system substantially.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/10\">This is all in the context of a country that remains one of the most competitive in the world, but it is not just about taxation; it is about planning, our rule of law and our amazing educational institutions. That is why Tata recently invested in a 40 GW gigafactory in Somerset, it is why &#216;rsted has decided to build the world&#8217;s biggest offshore wind farm in this country, and it is why AstraZeneca has decided to invest &#163;450 million in a new R&amp;D centre.</p><p pid=\"c641.1/11\">Investors look at a range of factors. It is not just about taxation; it is also about regulation. It is remarkable that the shadow Minister did not mention the Labour deputy leader&#8217;s obsession with introducing 70 new regulations on business, which would hinder business investment. It is the certainty of a Labour Government&#8217;s introduction of regulation that will hinder business investment, not anything that this Government have done in office. Looking at our achievements when it comes to business investment, the facts remain clear.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"b520.0/1\">Earlier this afternoon I counted over 50 right hon. and hon. Members of the Labour party alone packing the Opposition Benches for the urgent question on the middle east. Sadly, though predictably, by the time we got to this important debate we were down to the usual suspects&#8212;the usual stalwarts, about half a dozen to a dozen Members on each side of the House. That difference in the numbers is relevant: the reason for it is that an actual war is going on in the middle east, so people are very focused on it, now that it is too late to prevent it. Our purpose in holding debates such as this one should be not to get to that situation.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/2\">I have some reservations about the constant references to us being in a pre-war world. I know what the Secretary of State and others mean when they refer to that, but it can be taken as meaning that we are in a situation where war is inevitable, and it is not. We have to behave as if we were going to have to defend ourselves in a real war, because if we make those preparations adequately, we will, through a policy of deterrence, prevent the war from happening in the first place.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/3\">This close to a general election, it is perhaps inevitable that we will hear people on both sides of the House, but on the Front Benches in particular, quibbling over percentage points of GDP being allocated to defence expenditure. But I have to say that 2.5%, 3% or even 4% would not be anything like adequate if a war actually broke out&#8212;44% is probably more like what we would have to spend. This is not just about a loss of treasure; even worse, it is about the human suffering and loss of life that would happen if we fail to invest adequately in peacetime to prevent that from ever coming to pass.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/4\">The economist Roger Bootle recently explained:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b520.0/5\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;During the Second World War, we spent roughly 50% of GDP on the military and slightly more than this in 1916 and 1917, during the First World War.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"b520.0/6\">So for goodness sake, let us be serious about this. No Government can be exonerated for the Kool-Aid that they drank after the fall of the Berlin Wall.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/7\">During the 2015-17 Parliament, the Defence Committee spent a bit of time trying to establish what had happened to defence expenditure in the post-war era. What we found was this: in 1963 we spent similar sums&#8212;about 6% of GDP&#8212;on both welfare and defence; and by 2017, after the study was carried out, we were spending six times  as much on welfare as we were spending on defence. Similarly, it was found that in the mid-1980s we had been spending similar sums&#8212;about 5% of GDP then&#8212;on education, health and defence. By 2017 we were spending 2.5 times as much on education and nearly four times as much on health as we were spending on defence.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/8\">At the height of the cold war confrontation, and every year from 1981 to 1987, we spent between 4.3% and 5.1% of GDP on defence. From 1988&#8212;when the cold war began to evaporate&#8212;until 2014, defence spending almost halved as a proportion of GDP. Of course, there was a reason for that: it appeared that the threat from Russia had gone away. Well, now it is back. The question is this: are we prepared to revert to the sort of investment in defence in &#8220;peacetime&#8221; that we made so successfully during the 50 years of the cold war, which prevented an outbreak&#8212;a terrible further global conflict&#8212;between the then superpowers, both of which were armed with nuclear weapons?</p><p pid=\"b520.0/9\">I revert to what I said in an intervention on the Secretary of State when he was opening the debate: everything depends on what happens in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Let us be honest that when the threat of a Russian invasion of Ukraine arose in early 2022, not many people&#8212;hardly any in this Chamber, I suspect, myself included&#8212;predicted that Ukraine would be as successful as it has proved to be in resisting the might of the Russian invasion. I suspect that what had made that possible was that the shock that they had experienced in previous years over the loss of Crimea, which, if I remember correctly, was taken over by the Russians quite easily, focused their minds, their efforts and their investment upon the dire possibility that Russia might come back for more. That is why Ukraine was so much better prepared, with the covert assistance of other countries, not least this one, to resist the second Russian invasion when it happened.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/10\">I cannot stress too strongly that Ukraine&#8217;s battle is our battle. If Putin is seen to be unsuccessful in Ukraine, then the threat to us and to the rest of NATO will recede for a generation. However, if he is able to claim some sort of success, by ending up with significantly more territory at the end of the process than he had under his control in February 2022, then it will only be a matter of time before he comes back for more.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/11\">I want to say a few words about the middle east, but they are not actually my words; they are words from a remarkably perceptive article written by a Member of the upper House, the noble Lord Hague&#8212;William Hague, to us. He outlined his reaction to the atrocities of <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">7 October</phrase> in an astonishingly perceptive way in The Times within 48 hours of that attack. I want to set some of what he said on the record, because he raised the question of why on earth Hamas should have undertaken such an action when they must have known it would provoke a horrifying response. He asked the question:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b520.0/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Why, as well as murdering hundreds of defenceless young people at a rave, parade dead bodies as evidence of the atrocities? The answer is that their objective is uncontrolled rage. It is to make Israel lash out in a way that starts a conflagration. To start a war so intense that it spreads, igniting an explosion of violence in the West Bank and bringing in Hezbollah from Lebanon in the north, with Israel fighting on multiple fronts. To see so many   Palestinians killed that the Israelis lose the moral high ground of defending themselves against mass murder. To use the fate of hostages, with maximum cruelty, to intensify a frenzy of hatred whenever that seems to be abating.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"b520.0/13\">That is still going on now. We heard reference to the Israeli soldiers recently killed in a Hamas artillery strike close to the one entrance where aid was coming into Palestine. Guess what happened? The Israelis immediately closed that entrance, thus intensifying the crisis. The Hamas strategists clearly know what they are doing. It is horrible&#8212;devilish&#8212; but there is a cruel logic to it.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/14\">The heading that Lord Hague&#8212;or his sub-editor at The Times&#8212;used for that article was:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b520.0/15\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Hamas has set a trap that Israel must avoid: Iranian-backed attacks are desperate attempts to halt growing collaboration with Saudi Arabia and the UAE&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/16\">The only element that was missing in the article was that that strategy, promoted by Iran, was also extremely beneficial to Russia, because now we spend rather more time considering what is happening in Israel and Gaza than we spend considering what is happening between Russia and Ukraine, despite the fact that what is happening between Russia and Ukraine cannot be emphasised too often because it is of crucial significance to the future peace, or lack of peace, of NATO countries vis-&#224;-vis the Russian threat.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/17\">I will close with some remarks about the nuclear deterrent, which has been touched on a few times. One of the votes took place under Labour, as we have heard, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">14 March 2007</phrase>, when there was a substantial majority for the deterrent. Parliament voted by 409 votes to 161 in favour of proceeding with the initial gate for the renewal of the Trident submarine fleet; but even that huge majority of 248 was eclipsed on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">18 July 2016</phrase>, when under the Conservative Government&#8212;free from the coalition&#8212;the majority rose to 355 when MPs voted for the decisive main gate stage to proceed. That vote was won by 472 votes to 117.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/18\">That shows near unanimity in the House for the maintenance of our strategic nuclear deterrent&#8212;and all that happened before the various crises that we have been concentrating on today. Let us hope that unity prevails. I, for one, welcome the comments of the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, who said that his party is now committed to four submarines and to the maintenance of the continuous at-sea deterrent, which presumably means with the use of Trident missiles. I say &#8220;use&#8221; because they are used every day of the week. Their use is as a deterrent. If ever&#8212;heaven forbid&#8212;they had to be fired, they would fail in their purpose.</p><p pid=\"b520.0/19\">We have come a long way and we have made a lot of progress. It is just as well that we are united, given the way in which the international scene has darkened, but both Front Benches have a long way to go if they are to reach a stage where we are making the sort of investment, the sort of insurance and the sort of effort that has to be made to deter an aggressive Russia and to ensure that Ukraine prevails.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"b400.0/1\">I thank and commend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Alistair Carmichael\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10785\">the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland (Mr Carmichael)</phrase> for leading today&#8217;s debate. I attended his half-hour Westminster Hall debate on this issue and  supported him when he outlined his case in the short time he had. He has done exceptionally well today in doing the same thing, but in much more detail.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/2\">It is important to discuss pension schemes, and to ensure they are properly understood and regulated. There are still so many people out there who are misinformed, or do not really understand how pensions work or what their purpose is, so I am glad to be able to debate this issue. The Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Stephen Timms\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10596\">the right hon. Member for East Ham (Sir Stephen Timms)</phrase>, referred to auto-enrolment. I want to refer to it, too. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland set out a lot of detail, as did the Chair of the Select Committee and others, referring to a number of companies. Most people will obtain a pension at some stage of their lives and, through employment, will actively pay into it.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/3\">One point I would like to make, and which the Chair of the Select Committee referred to, relates to the provision of pensions for our young people and what steps we can take to ensure they understand that provision. This is another issue that I believe should be taught within learning for life and work. It should be in the curriculum and a part of our focus. The right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland said that he had his first pension at the age of 22. I had my first pension at the age of 18. My mother took me down to John Thompson &#8212;he is not here any more&#8212;who was the pension man in Ballywalter. I said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t need one.&#8221; He said, &#8220;Oh, you do.&#8221; And I signed up. Of course, you never say no to your mum. I certainly didn&#8217;t and I do not regret that. Over the years, and after taking out other pensions, all of a sudden they are quite valuable and exceptionally good to have. Also when I was an 18-year-old, my mother took me down to the Northern Bank&#8212;now Danske Bank &#8212;and opened an account for me. She gave me &#163;10 to start the account. Way back in the &#8217;60s, that was quite a lot of money. You could probably have bought a wee car at that time. I am not sure what state the car would have been in, but I think you could have bought one for &#163;10 or thereabouts. The point I am making is that it is important to save and to have a pension.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/4\">We ask young people to look to their future and to start to plan, but there is little provision within the education system to teach them about pensions, savings and mortgages, and there should be. I know that that is not the Minister&#8217;s direct responsibility, but perhaps he could give some assurance on whether it could become a subject for the curriculum. I have had conversations with my staff on the importance of paying into pensions. My youngest staff member&#8217;s response was exactly that. She bought her first house, saving for almost a decade for the deposit and paying thousands of pounds for mortgage advisers, insurance, solicitors fees and lenders fees. Young people are just about surviving to live in the present, but there is now an expectation that they must save in a pension for their futures. The purchase of a house is such a critical factor that a pension often takes second place. What steps can be taken to ease the financial burdens on our young people and enable them to see the benefits of taking advantage of pensions?</p><p pid=\"b400.0/5\">I recently asked a parliamentary question on considerations being given to a potential opt-in scheme for young people under the age of 18. There is massive  cause for this. Another two girls in my office have been working since the age of 13&#8212;part time, obviously, but still working&#8212;and so many young people out there are employed from as young as that. Why shouldn&#8217;t they reap some sort of benefit from working at that age? I understand the Government are to make a change to the Pensions (Extension of Automatic Enrolment) Act 2023 to enable that to happen in the &#8220;mid-2020s&#8221;. As we quickly approach that, perhaps the Minister could give an update on the matter and where it stands.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/6\">My last point on pensions relates to the WASPI women. This is not the subject of today&#8217;s debate, and there will be a debate on it in a fortnight&#8217;s time. I secured a debate last month in Westminster Hall on the issue. Although it is not the pension issue for today&#8217;s debate, the scale of the issue and its popularity highlights the importance of planning pensions. That is the point I want to refer to. The Minister will be aware that compensation is owed, but, given the nature of today&#8217;s debate, let me gently remind him that it is possible for lessons to be learnt. In setting the scene, the right hon. Member for Orkney and Shetland spoke of what had gone wrong and the need to ensure that it would not happen again, and we hope that, as a result of this debate and others, the issue of the WASPI women will never happen again either.</p><p pid=\"b400.0/7\">The incentive to save for the future must be there for people of all ages, not just young people but those in their 30s and 40s who voluntarily do not pay into their pensions because they do not think it worth their while, given the current cost of living and the many demands on their purses. It is also worth noting that some employers match employee contributions, while others pay considerably more. The incentive must be there for people to prepare for life after work, and I firmly believe that that should start in the LLW and careers sector of the education system. We should &#8220;learn them early&#8221;. We should reach young people in the right way and prepare them for the world that is to come, and pensions are clearly a part of that.</p>',\n",

He is held in high esteem in this House, in Parliament and in the outside world for the role that he played in that operation.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/2\">I was coming on to say that the reason why I have never been able to watch that programme again is that it was horrific. I was not in the services, and I did not go out to Bosnia. I watched that drama in my very early 20s, and I found it so horrific that even though it has been repeated since, and even though it is excellent, I have not been able to watch it. That must not be forgotten. <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Richard Foord\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/26086\">The hon. Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Richard Foord)</phrase> outlined some of the horrific scenes that took place&#8212;the butchery, the savagery, the hatred that led decent people and neighbours to carry out those acts. We have to recognise them in this House and never forget.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/3\">I had the privilege of being the international chairman of the Conservative party for a period. We did a lot of work with the Westminster Foundation for Democracy, a body through which Labour, Liberals and Conservatives work with their sister parties to help build democracies. It was set up after the Cold War. I am proud that I was able to work with three factions from the centre right in Bosnia, to get those right-wing parties around the table, talking and working towards developing a better future. I used to say, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know whether this will have any long-term effect, but at least I can one day look my maker in the eye and say that I tried.&#8221; I had a very tiny part in trying to make peace last, because that is what we have to do.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/4\">Tragically, in my opinion, Republika Srpska representatives did not turn up to the Rose-Roth seminar of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in November, apart from one person who very bravely did and got a hell of a lot of pushback for it. Its representatives have been disengaging. That is what I mean when I talk about the dangerous path that they are on. Take the history of the second world war. By about the 1960s, German society started to teach about the holocaust. That was a very important moment; it turned to education to make sure that history could not repeat itself. In Bosnia, however, not only are people not talking about some of the crimes against humanity that took place during the war, but in some of the schools in Republika Srpska, they are actually saying, &#8220;It&#8217;s lies&#8212;it didn&#8217;t happen. This the problem. We&#8217;ve got to separate out.&#8221; We should be highly concerned about that.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/5\">What lies behind all that is the arm of Russia. I have heard that Russia is not directly involved. It is not supplying arms; it is not doing some of the things that it has done in other parts of the world, such as Syria and Ukraine. However, the hand of Russia is there, politically and disruptively, and we do not have to look very far to see it. This is a critical moment.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/6\">My hon. Friend the Member for Rutland and Melton and my right hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham used the word &#8220;deterrent&#8221;. One thing we could do today is take a British battalion, in a NATO-led operation, to those areas, and act as a deterrent. I do not want any forces to have to try to stop the slaughter of innocent civilians. We now have an opportunity, in that the Minister is here to take these points back to the Foreign Office. I know that Ministers are always constrained in what they can and cannot say at the Dispatch Box, but we have to send a clear message in this debate.</p><p pid=\"b372.0/7\">History does not have to repeat itself. We do not have to have programmes that I have only ever been able to watch once in my life because I found them too horrific for me, let alone for the many Members of this House who served in Bosnia, or those now in the other place who were Ministers at the time, and had to deal with the consequences. There is ongoing trauma. I have met service personnel, some of whom served under my right hon. Friend the Member for Beckenham, and I have heard and seen the deep distress that they live with to this day, having tried to protect innocent civilians. That does not have to happen again. We can, and we need to, take action this day. That is the responsibility of the developed western world. It has responsibility for managing its military, and for the ethics that we apply to stop those who, purely as part of power-grabbing political games, play the nationalistic card, which will lead to murdered civilians. We see that today in Ukraine because we did nothing after Crimea.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"b995.1/1\">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman up to a point, and of course young people do not magically become much more self-sustainable and resilient the day after their 18th birthday, but there have been many improvements over the years. There is extended support for care leavers up to the age of 25, and there are arrangements whereby they can still have a relationship, including a financial relationship, for example with foster carers, through the &#8220;staying put&#8221; scheme the Government have come up with, and many charities and organisations do very good work in providing support, but the point the right hon. Gentleman makes is right. Most of us are lucky enough to be able to go running back home to birth families for help and support in difficult times, but that is not always available to young people in the care system, although many do have the continual support of good quality foster carers and other carers they relied on when they were under the age of 18. However, they are vulnerable, and ensuring these young people have a safe and stable home to start their adult lives is really crucial.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/2\">Housing can act as a vehicle for stability, and without access to good quality accommodation young people will face challenges in getting a job, staying in education and ongoing training, accessing health services and everything else. However, despite the key role housing can play in helping a young person transitioning to  independent living, many care leavers are struggling to find suitable accommodation in those early years after leaving care. It is estimated that one in three care leavers become homeless in the first two years immediately after they leave care, and one in four homeless people have been in care at some point in their lives, as I mentioned earlier.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/3\">Young care leavers face many barriers in accessing appropriate accommodation, and many will not be able to be addressed in this Bill. However, it does offer an opportunity to address one of those barriers: that landlords sometimes feel reluctant to rent to young people who have grown up in the care system. Young people in care tell charitable organisations in the youth sector that they come across landlords who are reluctant to rent to them because of their circumstances, and evidence from a survey of care leavers carried out by the charity Centrepoint found that over one in 10&#8212;some 13%&#8212;said they had been unable to access accommodation because the landlord was unwilling to accommodate them because of their status. That is not fair.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/4\">The problem is also likely to get worse given the growing evidence of a reduction in the number of private rental properties available across England. An investigation by the BBC found the number of properties available to rent across the whole of the UK had fallen by a third in the 18 months up to March 2023, and increased competition for the properties that are available has enabled more landlords to pick and choose which tenants they like, often going for the highest bidder, which of course makes it especially challenging for vulnerable groups such as care leavers.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/5\">In the last few years Barnardo&#8217;s has been running a campaign to try and improve access to suitable accommodation for care leavers. I certainly support the campaign, which calls on all local authorities to offer rent guarantor and deposit schemes for care leavers seeking to rent in the private rented sector. The MacAlister report on children in social care, which the Government commissioned and which was published last year, made a recommendation that being a care-experienced child should be a protected characteristic. So far in excess of 60 local authorities, including my own in West Sussex, have voluntarily acknowledged that, although the Government have not made it a statutory addition at this stage. So some local authorities are already providing help to care leavers, with deposits or a scheme where they can act as a corporate guarantor.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/6\">Such schemes greatly help make care-experienced young people more attractive tenants, and a number of local authorities report that such schemes have had significant successes. The scheme operated by Kent County Council has had no rent defaults from when it started in 2018 until 2021; however, such schemes are not offered by most local authorities. A freedom of information request by the Care Leaver Local Offer website to the 151 local authorities in England with a children&#8217;s social care department showed that 60% will not act as a guarantor for care leavers.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/7\">I understand Barnardo&#8217;s is currently in conversation with the Department for Education on how these schemes can be extended, with more local authorities being encouraged to develop them. That is welcome, but while such schemes will help, they will not be successful if  landlords continue to have a reluctance to rent to this group and instead pass them over in favour of younger professionals who can offer the backing of a family or personal guarantor or higher incomes on their own terms. That is why through this amendment I am urging the Minister to extend the provisions in the Bill to require landlords not to discriminate against certain groups of tenants including care leavers. Young people who have grown up in care have often faced very difficult circumstances in their lives, which is why they ended up in care, and when they came into the care of the state we agreed that we would become their corporate parent. I very much see the amendment as key to fulfilling this duty in providing important extra support to care leavers, ensuring more of them will be able to access safe and stable accommodation that they can call home.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/8\">In closing, I want to say that there is a basis for having a consideration for foster families as well. I know from my experience working with fostering groups that landlords can be reluctant to rent to foster families who have a number of children who will change and may be a little more problematic in some cases as well. However, foster families do an essential job and we are short of about 8,000 or 9,000 foster carers in this country, and the last thing we need is for them not to be able to offer a safe, stable, loving home to a child who has been through traumatic experiences because they cannot get into rented accommodation themselves as landlords do not want to be housing children who may be a little more challenging in some circumstances, but in most cases are not. So consideration must be given to the idea that landlords should regard foster-caring families as people to be encouraged because they are doing a noble and worthy job for vulnerable children, and, frankly, that is just the sort of tenant they should want to encourage. So perhaps in considering the way we treat care leavers themselves going out into the big wide world to rent we should also be mindful of the needs of foster carers, who have done such a fantastic job in picking those children and young people up and guiding them through to adulthood.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/9\">I want to secure the Minister&#8217;s commitment to work with colleagues particularly in the Department for Education, which has the lead responsibility for children in the care system, to consider how to involve landlords when developing new rent guarantor and deposit schemes for care leavers, and to agree to keep the issue under review with the possibility of using a power the Secretary of State has under the Bill to extend the non-discrimination clauses to groups such as children with care experience.</p><p pid=\"b995.1/10\">I know my hon. Friend the Minister is sympathetic to the thrust of my probing amendment and in his response and the Government&#8217;s official response on these matters we must send out a very clear signal that discriminating against children in the care system and care leavers is not on. People should have more of a duty of care to do everything they can to make sure those young people who have missed out on many of the things we take for granted&#8212;a safe and loving family at home&#8212;are not disadvantaged yet again by not being able to get a roof over their head. I hope the Minister will respond favourably to this probing amendment, and I am sure he will.</p>',\n",

       "  'body': '<p pid=\"a908.5/1\">It would not be an Adjournment debate without the hon. Gentleman&#8217;s contribution and I am grateful to him for it, because his point is well made. The budget cuts we have seen in Derbyshire have come alongside an increase in the population and there is an argument, which many of us in Derbyshire have made, that the authority has been particularly badly treated on the finances. The point he makes is a very valid one.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/2\">When the UK and Derbyshire were both run by Labour administrations, there were 56 of these children&#8217;s centres, but after 14 years, if these plans are approved, there will be just 12. The centres provide essential services such as health visits, speech and language development, healthy eating, parenting, school readiness,  family support, parenting groups and help to improve family relationships. We know that the work done by the staff in the centres has a massive benefit to the children and families that they help.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/3\">I was first elected to this place in 2010. During the election campaign, the issue of whether Sure Start was safe if the Conservatives were elected was a key plank of the Labour party campaign. The Conservatives furiously denied Gordon Brown&#8217;s claims that one in five Sure Start centres would be endangered if the Conservatives were elected. Well, in Derbyshire, Gordon Brown was indeed wrong: we have seen not one in five of these children centres close, but four in five. Now, the Government wonder why they are spending more than ever on the costs of failure, but they have failed to invest in the early years. When the Minister responds, can he tell us whether he believes that the loss of 44 of Derbyshire&#8217;s 56 children centres during the past 14 years of a Conservative Government is primarily down to electing a Conservative Government or down to electing a Conservative council?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/4\">We will come on in due course to the authority&#8217;s failings in special needs education, but at every school I visit, experienced headteachers say to me that they have never seen so many children with serious special needs. Has anyone in the Government considered whether the stripping away of these early years services may be contributing to the huge increase in the number of children presenting on their first day at school without being school ready and often in need of support with speech and language, dressing and toileting?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/5\">The authority got in touch with me and with other Derbyshire MPs to ask us to lobby Ministers for more money, which I and many other MPs did, as the authority was being charged excessive amounts by private providers of children&#8217;s services. Derbyshire has embarked on a savage programme of privatisation of services and so would be vulnerable to private sector overcharging, because it has crippled the strong publicly provided services that it inherited.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/6\">One feature of this Administration&#8217;s approach has been the unfortunate habit of marrying serial incompetence with careless arrogance and indifference to public opinion. The closure of these buildings is a case in point. Jon Pearce, Labour&#8217;s parliamentary candidate in High Peak, has teamed up with local Labour councillors to support the community&#8217;s plan to create a community hub and preserve the centre at Gamesley, which houses a youth club and boxing club in one of Derbyshire&#8217;s most deprived communities. Those clubs were shocked to receive a call out of the blue from DCC to say that they had a matter of weeks to find another venue, because the decision had already been made to close the building.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/7\">The community is attempting to form a constituted community organisation and has secured a three-month extension, but it is engaged in a race against time. We have also recently heard that Derbyshire County Council is looking to close two thirds of the care homes that it manages, as well as eight older people day centres. The right to dignity in old age is a sacred covenant in this country. Old people should know that when they work hard for their entire life and make a contribution to society, they should be able to retire with a degree of comfort and security. I feel that the covenant is now disintegrating before our eyes.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/8\">The governor from a school in Brampton was in such despair at the situation that she attended the most recent full meeting of Derbyshire County Council to set out that, to meet budgetary constraints while continuing to deliver the required level of care, the school is being forced to cut 160 teaching hours a week.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/9\">The cost of living crisis, spiralling rents and ever increasing mortgage rates are destroying the social contract in real time, and the inability of a council to provide services that facilitate for the most in need is a damning indictment of 14 years of Tory rule and local mismanagement. This situation could mean 162 vulnerable residents being turfed out on to the street. The council is now closing its own centres and using the private sector more&#8212;it is spending more and getting less. Spending on private care homes has increased by 61% since 2018-19, at a time when the authority has had to close seven of its own care homes, losing 156 beds. It has also closed 140 beds in its remaining 16 care homes and has around 30 vacancies. Where is the county&#8217;s duty of care to those living in its care homes? It is not as if the council is efficient. While Labour-run Chesterfield continues to enjoy the lowest council tax in the country, the Tory administration on the council has raised council tax by almost 5%. The need for social care for adults is only going to grow and grow as people live longer lives. I am sure we can all agree that this is a good problem to have, but more funding is needed from Government if councils are to be able to provide essential services such as this. Can the Minister set out the guidance he has provided to county councils and authorities to plan for the delivery of services in the context of demographic change and real-terms cuts to budgets?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/10\">The children of Derbyshire are suffering massively under the current council leadership, too. Spending on private schools for children with special needs has increased from &#163;5.7 million in 2018-19 to &#163;24 million in 2023-24, according to the schools forum report, while investment in council provision falters. At almost every single one of my weekly surgeries, I have parents in attendance who have children with special needs who are unable to get into a dedicated special needs establishment. Often, these children are excluded from their mainstream school&#8212;these children are missing months or, in some cases, years of their schooling&#8212;and are unable to make a mainstream placement work, but unable to access specialist provision.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/11\">It can now be revealed that, throughout this period of hardship, Derbyshire County Council has received around &#163;17.5 million of capital funding from the Department for Education since 2019 for additional special school places, but has spent a paltry &#163;1.5 million. That means &#163;16 million, or 91% of the budget it has received, is sat in Derbyshire County Council&#8217;s coffers, while parents of special needs children lose sleep every night at the lack of provision in our county. It is nothing short of a betrayal of those parents and their children. What can the Minister do to work with colleagues in the Department for Education to get this dysfunctional authority to deliver special needs placements for Derbyshire children?</p><p pid=\"a908.5/12\">The case of Brampton Primary School, which I referred to earlier, encapsulates all that is wrong with Derbyshire County Council&#8217;s budget allocation and service delivery. The school has an excellent special needs unit, but also has a tremendous reputation for how it has supported special needs children within its mainstream provision.  As a result of this reputation, many parents from well outside the Brampton catchment area who have special needs children will choose it for their children. However, this reputation for inclusivity comes at a tremendous cost to Brampton.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/13\">The primary school has 317 children on its roll, with 31% of these children having SEN. It is proud of its reputation for creating a supportive environment for children who have additional needs, but each child who has an education, health and care plan has the first &#163;6,000 of their extra costs covered by the school before any central funding comes in. On top of that, dozens of children are waiting for special needs assessments from the overwhelmed county council education service. While the children and their families wait for their assessment to be heard, the school receives no additional funding for these pupils at all.</p><p pid=\"a908.5/14\">A school that has gone out of its way to support those who have the greatest needs is crushing into the rocks of an inadequate funding mechanism and a county education service that is failing to support those children. Can the Minister explain how we can ensure that schools such as Brampton are not penalised for their own success in supporting special needs children?</p>',\n",

I remember, as a keen young Opposition spokesman, being your shadow when you were Local Government Minister, and I could never have had a more charming or skilful opposite number. I learned a lot from that.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/2\">I see sitting behind me two of my oldest friends in politics: my hon. Friends the Members for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond) and for Cities of London and Westminster (Nickie Aiken). We have been around the block&#8212;literally&#8212;in various local government campaigns in London over many years. It is a certain irony that we have all decided to depart at the same time; that will probably be cause for a good lunch at some point. I have not forgotten that I owe the Minister one as well.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/3\">I pay tribute to the Minister for his approach. I totally agree with the shadow Minister, to whom I am also grateful&#8212;he has been a good friend in relation to this and to issues about the performing arts and music, which we have both championed in this place&#8212;as well as the SNP spokesman.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/4\">The Minister has been exemplary in his approach. We are fortunate in the team of Ministers that we currently have at the Ministry of Justice, including him and my right hon. and learned Friend the Secretary of State and Lord Chancellor&#8212;although he is not here today,  his name is on the amendments&#8212;who is a quite exceptional lawyer, a quite exceptional Lord Chancellor, a star in this Chamber and somebody whose integrity and commitment to the legal system will be long recognised.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/5\">These are improvements to the Bill&#8212;I am glad about that. May I also thank the Ministry of Justice officials? I have dealt with many of them over the years. I am sorry that they have had to put up with some of the things that the Justice Committee has lobbed at them over that time, but there has always been a great, constructive spirit. In that context, I particularly welcome the fact that the Government have taken on board a number of the Select Committee&#8217;s recommendations in relation to our pre-legislative scrutiny of what was then simply the Victims Bill and became the Victims and Prisoners Bill, as well as some, although not all, of our recommendations in relation to IPP prisoners; more on that in a moment.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/6\">The scrutiny of the Victims Bill was particularly led by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Maria Eagle\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10183\">the right hon. Member for Garston and Halewood (Maria Eagle)</phrase>, who served as my deputy on the Committee before she was rightly recalled to the Opposition Front Bench. I thank her too for the support she gave me on the Committee and the particular work she did for her constituents and for a better and fairer approach for victims in these cases. I also congratulate <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Diana R. Johnson\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/11647\">the right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Dame Diana Johnson)</phrase>, whom I first met when we were both elected to the London Assembly in 2000, for the exceptional work she has done in relation to infected blood. We can work cross-party on these matters and she has performed a great service.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/7\">In relation to some of the remaining parts of the Bill, I am glad the Government have moved on the matters set out here. The co-operation with the commissioner is good news and I think we all know that the duty of candour is valuable and to be welcomed; perhaps it could go further, but let us accept it is a step in the right direction.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/8\">The use of public protection and powers in relation to the recall of prisoners and the extension of home curfew are sensible measures. Home curfew is important. I will say it yet again, because I may not have another chance to do so: we need to be more intelligent as a society in the way we use imprisonment, which is expensive, and the way we use it at the moment is not always effective. Alternative tools in the sentencing box, including the use of home detention curfews, enable us to get a better approach to balancing punishment, which is legitimate, with rehabilitation, which is what we have  to aim for if we are to reduce reoffending. If we want to reduce the number of victims of crime, we want to reduce reoffending. Home detention curfews and other measures are a valuable step towards doing that. They are by no means the whole answer, but any advance is to be welcomed.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/9\">I regret that in the wash-up we do not have the Sentencing Bill, because that would have taken many more valuable steps towards a more balanced and rational approach to sentencing policy. I hope whoever is in government after the general election will return to the issues in the Sentencing Bill, not least because many of them had cross-party support.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/10\">The campaign on IPP prisoners has attracted massive cross-party support both here and in the other House. Our Committee took compelling evidence on it, and in particular I want to thank those who championed it in the other place, including my good friend Lord Moylan, and Lord Blunkett. I wish the Government had gone further and introduced the resentencing exercise proposal put forward powerfully by Lord Thomas of Cwmgiedd, the former Lord Chief Justice; I still think there is merit in that.</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/11\">I would like to end by paying tribute to someone who, sadly, cannot hear the words because yesterday I was at Middle Temple for the memorial service to the late Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, one of the most exceptional men I have ever met. He was an exceptional lawyer, one of the last of the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary&#8212;the Law Lords&#8212;and one of the first of the Supreme Court. At an age when many would be putting their feet up, he was regularly in the House of Lords until a month before he died. He regularly championed the case of IPP prisoners, and coined the phrase</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a1155.1/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;stain on our criminal justice system&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, House of Lords, <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">7 September 2017</phrase>; Vol. 783, c. 2074.]</p><p pid=\"a1155.1/13\">Those were Simon&#8217;s words. He will be pleased, up wherever he is, to have heard the words from the Minister that there will be movement, but I hope that one day we will return to the Simon Brown memorial amendment, the resentencing exercise amendment. That exceptional person, who inspired me and many others, and his family will deserve that, because if it is possible to be both a lawyer and public figure and a great human being, Simon Brown epitomised that, and that is something we can perhaps all learn from.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p>My Rt. Hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health, Start for Life and Primary Care (Andrea Leadsom MP) has made the following Written Statement:</p><p>On 7 February 2024 the government published our report: <em>Faster, simpler and fairer: our plan to recover and reform NHS dentistry, </em>to accelerate the recovery of NHS dentistry from the COVID-19 pandemic. The plan will fund up to 2.5 million additional appointments, or more than 1.5 million additional courses of dental treatment and is already delivering with over 500 more dental practices showing themselves as open to new patients as of 9 May. Our commitment is to improve access to NHS dental care so that those who need to see a dentist are able to, especially in under-served parts of the country.</p><p>A key priority for this Government is to grow capacity within dentistry so that there are more NHS dentists delivering care to patients. The NHS Long Term Workforce Plan sets an ambition to increase dentistry places by 40%. This is the biggest numerical expansion of NHS training places in the history of the NHS and will mean that by 2031 we are training 1,100 dentists each year.</p><p>However, training more dentists is not the sole solution to current workforce challenges in NHS dentistry. We need dentists to do more NHS work alongside, or instead of, their private work.</p><p>More than 35,000 dentists are registered with the General Dental Council in England. However, only 24,151 dentists delivered at least some NHS activity in England in 2022 to 2023. This means that nearly one-third of registered dentists are not contributing to NHS dentistry and may be exclusively working in private practice. Furthermore, data published today by the NHS Business Services Authority shows that of those that are delivering NHS dental activity, some dentists are making only a token commitment to NHS dentistry.</p><p>The government estimates that training an individual dentist from the beginning of dental school through to graduation can cost up to approximately &#163;292,000, of which costs in the region of &#163;200,000 are not repayable by the student. We believe it is right and fair to seek better value for the significant investment that the taxpayer makes in the education and training of the dental workforce, and for graduate dentists to invest their skills and expertise in the NHS for the benefit of patients. This NHS experience will be of great benefit to them throughout their practice, as well as enabling better access for patients.</p><p>That is why we are today publishing a consultation on introducing a &#8216;tie-in&#8217; for graduate dentists. The introduction of a minimum NHS service requirement, or &#8216;tie-in&#8217;, would aim to ensure that newly qualified dentists spend at least some of their time delivering NHS dental care in the years following the completion of training. This may include working in a &#8216;high street&#8217; primary care dental practice, secondary care, community dentistry or dental public health.</p><p>The consultation will seek views on two main principles:</p><ul><li>newly qualified dentists should commit to delivering at least a minimum amount of NHS dental care, for a minimum number of years after graduating.</li><li>newly qualified dentists should repay some of the public funding invested in their education and training if they do not deliver a minimum amount of NHS dental care.</li></ul><p>The morale and wellbeing of our highly skilled and hard-working dental workforce is of utmost priority. I want to thank the many hard-working dentists for all their efforts as we have seen real improvements over the past year. We want to make NHS work more attractive to ensure NHS dentists are incentivised to deliver NHS care. As part of this, we have already announced a package of reforms to improve patient access and provide fairer remuneration for dentists. We are also supporting our excellent dental staff to work at the top of their training, and encouraging more hard-working dentists to those areas of England that are currently under-served.

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a307.2/1\">I beg to move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a307.2/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered bus services in England.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/3\">It is a pleasure to serve with you in the Chair, Ms Vaz. Connecting communities through better public transport has been one of my top priorities since I was elected in December 2019 by the fine people of Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke. I am therefore delighted to have secured funding&#8212;with my hon. Friends the Members for Stoke-on-Trent South (Jack Brereton) and for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Jo Gideon)&#8212;for the return of the Stoke-Leek line, millions more to fix the potholes that drive us potty in the Potteries, and upgrades to Stoke-on-Trent railway station and Station Road. However, like other Members from across the House, I know that buses remain the most important and valued form of public transport.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/4\">Stoke-on-Trent&#8217;s road network harks back to the Victorian era. The city is made up of six towns in an unconventional layout, and fewer residents than the national average own or have access to a motor vehicle. Other major cities benefit from underground networks, and in some cases trams, but our city relies solely on its good-quality bus network. Buses are vital in connecting our communities across Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke. They enable people to shop, eat and drink, see loved ones, get to school or college, attend a local GP appointment or enjoy one of the many great tourist attractions our city has to offer, such as the Spitfire gallery in the Potteries Museum and Art Gallery.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/5\">Despite the large number of people who require or would like to use the bus, the local bus network across Britain shrunk by an estimated 14% between 2016-17 and 2021-22. The BBC reported in early 2023 that about 13% of bus services across England are supported by councils. That places heavier pressure on local authority budgets, which are more stretched than ever since covid and the cost of living pressures that resulted in large part from the post-covid global recovery and Putin&#8217;s illegal and immoral war in Ukraine, which spiked energy costs and fuelled inflation.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/6\">Bus demand plummeted during the global covid-19 pandemic, and is still recovering; reports show that passenger numbers across Britain, excluding London, remain about 20% below pre-pandemic levels. In Stoke-on-Trent, we have felt that more than most other areas. Across the city, bus services shrank by an estimated 50% between 2013-14 and 2021-22. However, it is important to caveat that: to a large extent, the reductions came not from the closure of entire routes, but from repeated timetable changes that, by sleight of hand, reduced how frequently buses arrive or how late into the evening they run.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/7\">In summer 2022, I hosted two well-attended meetings in Chell Heath and Smallthorne, at which local residents and I held First Potteries and D&amp;G to account. We were determined to ensure that the operators stop slashing routes, which is making it harder for local people to get around. Residents told me that they need better and  more straightforward routes to places such as Leek&#8212;passengers are currently required to change buses&#8212;and a direct link to Wolstanton retail park to do their shopping. Elderly passengers told me that the lack of routes made them isolated. Parents told me that their children could not get to their college or apprenticeship easily. Businesses told me that the lack of routes was a challenge for recruitment and retention, as many employers still work on shift patterns that do not work within existing timetables. Shops on our high streets felt that the poor quality of service meant that people were shopping outside Stoke-on-Trent.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/8\">That argument was reinforced by a survey I conducted of more than 1,000 local residents across Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke. Some 76% said they would use the bus to go shopping, and 57% said they would undertake more leisure activities, if better bus services were available. In addition, 64% said bus services could be improved by having better routes to get them to different parts of the city so that they can get out and about. Residents also expressed their desire for better services in the evening, with 49.6% saying bus services could be improved if they ran later. That is especially the case for women and girls, who might be concerned about getting home safely.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/9\">I have outlined the challenges we face nationally and in Stoke-on-Trent, but it would be unfair not to mention the unprecedented support and subsidy that bus operators have received since I was elected in 2019, particularly during the pandemic, when passenger numbers plummeted because people were staying at home to protect loved ones. Since 2020 the Government have announced more than &#163;4.5 billion of funding for buses in England, outside of London. Between March 2020 and June 2023, over &#163;2&#160;billion of taxpayers&#8217; hard-earned money was used in emergency and recovery funding to mitigate the impact of the covid pandemic on the bus sector. The Department for Transport also makes up to &#163;259&#160;million available every year for bus operators and local authorities to help operators keep fares down and run services that might otherwise be unprofitable and could be cancelled. Without that support, we would simply have seen services cease entirely, and bus operators go out of business. I therefore pass on my thanks to the Government for intervening. I also thank the many bus drivers who kept going into work, particularly in the early stages of the pandemic, when we had no vaccine. Simply by turning up to work, they were putting themselves in harm&#8217;s way.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/10\">In addition to the covid recovery grant, Councillors Abi Brown and Daniel Jellyman, my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South and I successfully campaigned for and received over &#163;31&#160;million for Stoke-on-Trent to improve our bus services through the bus service improvement plan, enabling us to start busing back better. We bid for new bus routes across the city, based on concerns we had heard from residents and businesses across Stoke-on-Trent. Our goal was to help thousands more people get around the city, while reducing congestion on our road network. We also campaigned for better bus stops and shelters across the city. I was recently on Chell Heath Road, where we can see investment to improve boarding kerbs, which will be particularly helpful for elderly and disabled residents. We want to improve the quality of bus shelters to encourage people on to the buses in bad weather and to have electronic boards to ensure that people can keep on track of the new and improved services.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/11\">To improve existing routes in Stoke-on-Trent North, Kidsgrove and Talke, the 8 and 36/36A services have been extended. The improved 36/36A service means the bus routes start earlier and finish much later, better connecting the three towns in Stoke-on-Trent North&#8212;Kidsgrove, Tunstall and Burslem. That means people can enjoy a day out at Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire&#8217;s award-winning indoor market in Tunstall, enjoy a pint or two at the Bull&#8217;s Head in Burslem, see the mighty Port Vale on match day at Vale Park, and visit the mother town of Stoke-on-Trent&#8212;Burslem&#8212;to enjoy the historic Middleport Pottery and a tour around Titanic Brewery.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/12\">The extension of the No.&#160;8 route means that the people of Ball Green, Norton and Smallthorne will benefit from a weekend service, enabling them to get to and from the city centre, which needs to see increased footfall. It will also enable elderly relatives to see their family and friends more easily. For too long communities, particularly in wards such as Baddeley, Milton and Norton, have felt disconnected from the city and all it has to offer. Councillors Dave Evans and Carl Edwards have lobbied relentlessly with me to improve connectivity. There is still more to be done on the location of bus stops in the ward, but this is a good first step to better connecting communities.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/13\">It is not just Stoke-on-Trent that is reaping the benefits of bus funding. Bus funding for Staffordshire County Council has been used to introduce, for the first time in years, a bus service that connects Mow Cop and Harriseahead with the rest of Newchapel, Kidsgrove, Whitehill, Talke and Butt Lane. The brand-new 95 route enables residents to get down to Clough Hall Park or Kidsgrove Sports Centre to keep fit and active, or to enjoy a coffee or some shopping at the Affinity shopping centre. The conversations I have had on doorsteps indicate that the route, run by D&amp;G, has been warmly received by local residents. I have been a passenger myself, and by hopping on at one of our nearest bus stops&#8212;the Butt Lane Co-op on Cedar Avenue&#8212;my family and I can enjoy a day out, such as seeing Jodrell Bank from Mow Cop castle.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/14\">This landmark investment also creates fairer fares for passengers. We have been able to cut bus fares by a third with a new &#163;3.50-a-day flat fare, which has massively helped to drive up footfall and consumer confidence in our local bus service. On a recent visit to the First Potteries depot in Stoke-on-Trent, I spoke with staff about the impact of the Government&#8217;s &#163;31.7&#160;million investment in Stoke-on-Trent&#8217;s bus services. Staff told me that there has been an improvement since the funding came in, and that is backed up by research from Transport Focus, which reveals that Stoke-on-Trent is now ranked fourth for most satisfied bus users and second for value for money. Believe me, those are figures I did not think I would see when I was first elected.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/15\">I was also told of the positive impact of the &#163;3.50-a-day fare cap and the &#163;2 fare on single journeys, which supports over 5,000 routes across England, including those in Stoke-on-Trent, Kidsgrove and Talke. Transport Focus&#8217;s research has revealed that 11% of respondents are using the bus more thanks to the capped fare, with 80% agreeing that the &#163;2 ticket has helped with the cost of living. That research is supported by Department for Transport statistics, which show that, following the  introduction of the cap, bus fares in England, outside of London, dropped by 6.2% between December 2022 and December 2023, and by over 11% in rural and non-metropolitan areas. However, in Scotland, Wales and London&#8212;where buses are devolved&#8212;fares increased by 9.8%, 8.1% and 6% respectively.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/16\">In addition to the landmark &#163;31 million to bus back better, communities across England such as Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire are benefiting from the Prime Minister&#8217;s bold new vision for the midlands and north, with a huge uplift in funding as a result of the cancellation of the northern leg of High Speed 2. The reallocation of &#163;36 billion from HS2 will mean that Stoke-on-Trent and Staffordshire cumulatively benefit from over &#163;200 million in additional funding for our roads and pavements, while Stoke-on-Trent will receive &#163;19 million a year over the next seven years for transport from the local government transport fund. That unprecedented investment will help us compete with London and the south-east, which typically have better roads and transport links, in part because they generate more revenue from council tax and parking fees in comparison to northern towns and cities such as Stoke-on-Trent.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/17\">I am campaigning to support elderly and disabled residents to use their concessionary bus passes before 9.30 am. Research from the House of Commons Library shows that in 2020 almost a quarter of older persons across the country and just over a third of disabled people were allowed to use their bus passes before 9.30 am by local authorities. Not every concessionary bus pass user will need to travel early every day, but it gives vulnerable people security to know that, when they do, they will not be charged. We cannot put a price on giving those who need support the confidence to travel around Stoke-on-Trent and the surrounding area.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/18\">At Prime Minister&#8217;s questions on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">29 November 2023</phrase>, I was delighted that the Prime Minister supported my campaign to scrap the cap, saying that he &#8220;wholeheartedly&#8221; backed it. However, Labour-led Stoke-on-Trent City Council has so far failed to back it. In misleading comments given to the BBC, cabinet member Councillor Chris Robinson said Stoke-on-Trent City Council was not responsible for setting the timings for concessionary fares. I have therefore written to Councillor Robinson to make it clear that Department for Transport guidance states that free travel is at the discretion of local authorities, with the guidance stating:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a307.2/19\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The national bus concession in England is available at any time on a Saturday, Sunday or bank holiday, and from 9.30 am to 11 pm on any other day.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a307.2/20\">It goes on to say that travel concession authorities</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a307.2/21\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;are able to offer concessionary travel outside these hours on a discretionary basis.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a307.2/22\">Despite having written over 100 days ago, I am yet to hear back from any of the Labour councillors in the cabinet of Stoke-on-Trent City Council. However, with the backing of over 1,600 local people via my &#8220;Scrap the Cap&#8221; petition, I am determined to keep going and ensure that no excuse is used, particularly now that there has been such a substantial increase in Stoke-on-Trent City Council&#8217;s transport budget.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/23\">Lots of residents have written to me to say why they back the campaign. Pamela from Tunstall says:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a307.2/24\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Many pensioners can&#8217;t afford to own a car and need buses to get to appointments. The older we become the more important it is to have access to the bus.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a307.2/25\">Roland from Talke Pits asks:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a307.2/26\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;What is the point in having a free bus travel pass when it restricts people at a time when it is most needed not only for convenience, but to save money which in most cases these people can ill afford to lose.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a307.2/27\">Roderick from Milton says:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a307.2/28\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;Being able to use the buses before 9.30 would mean that it would be a lot easier to make connections to other buses and to be able to get to Stoke Station to catch earlier trains.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a307.2/29\">It is therefore vital that Stoke-on-Trent Labour listens and delivers for residents by backing my campaign. I hope the Minister will use today to join myself and the Prime Minister in calling on Stoke-on-Trent City Council to scrap the cap.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/30\">When visiting the First Potteries depot a few weeks ago, I spoke to Zoe Hands from First Bus about the exciting opportunity for a new electric bus fleet to come to Stoke-on-Trent. First Bus is ready and willing to invest &#163;37 million in a brand-new electric bus fleet for our great city, but this ambition must be met with an around &#163;11 million investment from Stoke-on-Trent City Council. These brand-new buses would not only encourage travel because they would be more modern and exciting but make a huge difference to improving air quality in Stoke-on-Trent. The fleet we currently have roaming around our city is old, and a more reliable, modern fleet would reduce the number of costly repairs, keeping buses on our roads and out of workshops.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/31\">I am therefore working with First Potteries and my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent South to make sure Stoke-on-Trent City Council plays its part in facilitating this exciting plan and invests that &#163;11 million to support a new, sustainable bus fleet. First Bus has made it clear that if the council can deliver the necessary investment and infrastructure, these new buses could begin carrying passengers in early 2025. The Government have already shown their ambition by allocating over &#163;460 million in dedicated funding for zero-emission buses in this Parliament, of which Staffordshire County Council has already been a recipient. I have now written to Stoke-on-Trent City Council about these exciting plans, and I hope the council will deliver for people in Stoke-on-Trent and make this sensible investment to enhance the city&#8217;s bus network.</p><p pid=\"a307.2/32\">In conclusion, as I have laid out, good local bus services are so important for local communities. They help to drive people on to our high streets, to encourage growth and investment and to liberate the elderly and disabled, giving them more freedom to get out and about. They provide health benefits by reducing congestion and improving air quality, and they help people get to work or college, which they would otherwise have been unable to do. In short, buses are pivotal to achieving levelling up, which matters hugely. If we really want to transform communities such as Stoke-on-Trent, we must ensure that the infrastructure exists to empower and embolden their people and businesses. To do that, there has to be a reliable public transport network to help people get around. Buses are the most popular form of transport and serve as great liberators for millions of people. It is vital that we get them right.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a548.0/1\">I beg to move, That the Bill be now read the Third time.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/2\">I am pleased that the Bill&#8217;s passage through the House has been relatively smooth, so I thank the Government and indeed the Opposition for their support. Although the Bill&#8217;s scope is narrow, it will provide  financial assurance to those who have received the devastating diagnosis of a terminal illness and who have also seen the sponsors of their pension schemes become insolvent. The Bill will do that by amending the definition of the words &#8220;terminally ill&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/3\">When someone receives the awful news that they may have only months to live, it is only right that financial problems should be the least of their worries. The loss of their rightful pension payments should not mean that they must live out their remaining time constrained by their financial circumstances. The Bill aims to address that problem directly.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/4\">For wider context, the Bill focuses on the Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme. The Pension Protection Fund, established by the Pensions Act 2004, pays compensation to individuals when the sponsors of their defined-benefit schemes&#8212;usually their employers&#8212;become insolvent and lack the necessary assets to pay those pensions to the level that the Pension Protection Fund ordinarily would. That is for cases when such insolvency takes place on or after <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">6 April 2005</phrase>. The financial assistance scheme applies to individuals whose pension schemes were unable to meet their pensions liabilities in full when those schemes started to wind up between <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">1 January 1997</phrase> and <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">5 April 2005</phrase>. The Bill concerns the compensation payments made to people diagnosed with a terminal illness from those schemes.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/5\">The Pension Protection Fund provides a one-off lump sum payment to those who receive such a diagnosis, while the financial assistance scheme will begin to make payments to someone at any age. The issue that the Bill seeks to address is the definition of a terminal illness.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/6\">The Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme both use the same legal definition of terminal illness, which that is that</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a548.0/7\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;a person is &#8216;terminally ill&#8217; at any time if at that time the person suffers from a progressive disease and the person&#8217;s death in consequence of that disease can reasonably be expected within 6 months.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a548.0/8\">The same definition was used by the Department for Work and Pensions for the purpose of calculating benefits, but that was reformed in the Social Security (Special Rules for End of Life) Act 2022, where the six-month period included in the definition of &#8220;terminally ill&#8221; was extended to 12 months. The change in definition for these two pension schemes seems only logical. That would keep the definition consistent with making social security payments.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/9\">It is difficult to say how many people will benefit from the Bill, and in reality we do not really want people to benefit as that would mean that the sponsors of their pension funds have become insolvent, which we do not want to see. However, where that is the case, this legislation will benefit terminally ill people.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/10\">The Bill&#8217;s scope is technically limited to the Pension Protection Fund and the financial assistance scheme, but I hope it will encourage any workplace pension that does not have provision for terminal illness, where the member has a life expectancy of 12 months or less, to consider putting such a scheme into place. Depending on the scheme&#8217;s rules, many private pension schemes can already make what are called serious ill health payments under tax law, if the member has up to one year to live. The change will be well worth making.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/11\">The heartbreaking job of giving a terminal illness diagnosis falls to health professionals. Modern medicine, surgery, palliative care and the general care provided by our incredible NHS staff make that judgment even more difficult. It is therefore right to extend the definition of terminally ill from the narrow band of six months to the more accommodating threshold of 12 months. That is fairer not only to the ill person but to those who have to make the difficult judgment, especially when those health professionals know that a person&#8217;s pension payments may rest on that.</p><p pid=\"a548.0/12\">As we just heard, the Bill extends throughout the United Kingdom, and comes into force in England, Scotland and Wales four months after Royal Assent, and likewise in the case of Northern Ireland. I commend it to the House.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a676.1/1\">I thank noble Lords.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/2\">Some noble Lords were concerned that the Bill restricts landlords&#8217; ability to charge a market rent. I will be very clear: this Government do not believe in rent controls, unlike the noble Baroness, Lady Jones. Nothing in this Bill prevents landlords increasing rents to the market rate each year or dictates what rent they can charge at the start of a tenancy. Tenants can appeal above-market-rate increases to the First-tier Tribunal, which will make an objective assessment and determine whether to raise, or indeed lower, the proposed rent. The noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, referred to the First-tier Tribunal&#8212;I think he wanted it to go. We are working closely with the Ministry of Justice and the judiciary to assess the impact on the First-tier Tribunal of this new Bill. We anticipate that the reforms will lead to an increase in cases, but we will ensure that the tribunal has the capacity to deal with these cases.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/3\">Regarding overall supply, noble Lords asked what measures in the Bill will mean for supply in the private rental sector. I will try to reassure noble Lords&#8212;if not today, maybe as we go through the Bill&#8212;including the noble Lords, Lord Frost and Lord Carrington, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton, that there is no evidence to suggest that a fairer private rental sector for tenants and landlords will lead to a reduction in supply. The statistics I have from the department suggest that the sector doubled in size from 2004, peaking in 2016, and has remained roughly stable since then; we will continue to monitor the impacts. New costs to landlords are expected to amount to a tiny fraction of average annual rents, at approximately &#163;10 per landlord in England. We are by no means complacent and recognise the vital role that good landlords play in providing homes for millions of people across the country. That is why the Bill requires the department to provide an annual update to Parliament on the state of the private rented sector, to include stock, size and location of properties.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/4\">With regards to social housing supply, noble Lords have heard me talk at this Dispatch Box, on a number of occasions, about the affordable homes programme of &#163;11.5 billion. I will not rehearse those arguments today in the interests of time, but they underpin the supply part of the equation. Since 2010, there have been an additional 482,000 affordable homes for rent, of which 172,600 are for social rent.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/5\">On retired clergy, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chelmsford raised concerns that the Church of England Pensions Board will no longer be able to evict existing tenants to house retired clergy. The way this has been achieved until now is through the use of Section 21, which we are abolishing. Ground 5 allows landlords to evict tenants from properties which are usually held to allow ministers of religion to perform their duties when needed again for that purpose. She is therefore correct that the ground will not apply in situations where they wish to house retired clergy. We have carefully considered the needs of tenants and religious organisations when reviewing the grounds for possession, and we believe that the ground balances the unique needs of the sector&#8212;ensuring that religious ministers can occupy properties where needed to carry out their duties&#8212;with the rights of existing tenants.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/6\">I will write to the noble Baronesses, Lady Pinnock and Lady Warwick, about the ground 1B impact on social landlords and how we will select the administrator for the PRS ombudsman. I bow to the experience of ombudsmen of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, which is much greater than mine, but I can tell her that the Bill allows for government either to select a scheme through an open competition or to appoint a provider to deliver a designated scheme. To reiterate, we have not made a final decision on what is happening, and we are not ruling out the possibility of delivering this through alternative provision. Our priority is choosing a provider that offers a high-quality, value-for-money service. I will seek the clarification that she has asked for and will revert with more detail on the process being used as discussions continue on the Bill.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/7\">On the cost of the ombudsman, which the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, raised, it is right that the landlords pay for this scheme. It is in line with common practice for funding other redress schemes, including for social landlords, who pay some &#163;5.75 per unit for membership of the Housing Ombudsman scheme. We will ensure that the fee for private rental is proportionate and good value.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/8\">On portal offences, local authorities will have a duty to enforce where landlords fail to comply with their portal obligations. Tenants who become aware that a landlord is, for example, not registered on the portal or has provided inaccurate information can contact their local authority so that they can take the appropriate enforcement action.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/9\">I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, that we recognise the importance of having a healthy supply of private rented homes at affordable prices in all parts of the country, which is why we are taking decisive steps to stop short-term lets undermining the supply of long-term homes for local people. This includes abolishing the furnished holiday lettings tax regime, introducing a national mandatory register of short-term lets, and introducing a new planning use class for short-term lets.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/10\">On the suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, that we should introduce a specialist housing court, we do not think that this is the best way to improve the court process for possession. This view is shared by the judiciary, which responded to our call for evidence. A new housing court would not address the concerns raised by landlords, such as the timeliness and complexity  of the processes. We are committed to reforming the court system instead. Indeed, the majority of tenancies end without ever going to court. For those that do, where court reform is necessary, we will make sure that the system is working. The new system will have great new training for the analogue system to do the immediate new contracts, followed by digitisation. I am a lot more optimistic that new, large digitisation projects can now be delivered on time, and I am confident that we will be able to scope and deliver this as quickly as needed.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/11\">If it is okay with the House, I will continue, as there is not much left. On the portal duplicating the work of selective licensing, unlike the property portal, selective licensing schemes aim to target specific local issues by enabling more intensive, proactive enforcement strategies. The two are therefore complementary and do not prevent each other from working.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/12\">The question from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Etherton, was very detailed and, I am sure, very precise. I will write to him on it once my department&#8217;s legal experts have had time to consider his points&#8212;otherwise, I am in danger of stepping into waters that I cannot.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/13\">With regard to the comments on guarantors, we recognise that some tenants have difficulties in meeting such requirements. The use of guarantors and upfront rent can give landlords confidence to rent to individuals they might otherwise not choose to, but we will continue to carefully monitor both practices, to ensure that they are not having an adverse effect on the market. We have already committed to limiting upfront rent through the Tenant Fees Act if necessary.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/14\">With regard to the death of a tenant, we are extending the period for ground 7 to be used. The Government are aware that tenants who have been living in a property for a while may reasonably believe that they have a right to remain living there, which is why we have introduced an extension from 12 to 24 months to help resolve cases where disputes might arise, particularly for grieving tenants.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/15\">With regard to legal aid, which was mentioned by the noble Baronesses, Lady Thornhill and Lady Lister, the Ministry of Justice is investing an additional &#163;10 million a year in housing legal aid through the non-means-tested Housing Loss Prevention Advice Service&#8212;HLPAS&#8212;to give people the best chance of keeping their home when they fall into difficult financial times. Through this scheme, tenants can receive free, non-means-tested advice as soon as they receive written notice that their landlord is seeking possession of their home. The MoJ is funding a panel of specialist legal advisors to provide grant funding for the recruitment of trainee solicitors to support that endeavour. Free on-the-day legal help will continue to be available when a tenant is facing the loss of their home at a possession hearing in the county court.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/16\">It is true that private landlords must meet existing minimum efficiency standards&#8212;the MEES regulations&#8212;which are set at EPC E. Although we will not tighten that requirement, as we have in the social sector, we will work with landlords. We are currently investing some &#163;6 billion this Parliament and a further &#163;6 billion to 2028 on making buildings cleaner and warmer; this  is in addition to the &#163;5 billion that will be delivered through the energy company obligation, ECO4, and the Great British insulation scheme up until March 2026. Landlords can and should participate in these schemes to upgrade their properties.</p><p pid=\"a676.1/17\">In conclusion, I thank all noble Lords&#8212;</p>',\n",

       "   'body': \"<p>In a parliamentary debate on 23 October 2023, I announced the Government&#8217;s intention to update the UK&#8217;s gamete donation regulations. The first change would allow people living with HIV with an undetectable viral load to donate their gametes. The second change would update the definition of partner donation to include female same-sex couples, therefore reducing costs for those undergoing reciprocal IVF.</p><p>Today, we will lay the necessary regulations to make these changes, which will benefit patients across the whole of the UK, supported by scientific advice from the Advisory Committee for the Safety of Blood Tissues &amp; Organs.</p><p>Firstly, this will allow people living with HIV to donate their gametes to family, friends and known recipients provided that:</p><ul><li>They have a sustained viral load of less than 200 per millilitre ('undetectable viral load');</li><li>They have been receiving antiretroviral treatment for at least 6 months prior to donation; and</li><li>The recipient knows of their HIV diagnosis and provides informed consent.</li></ul><p>These changes will benefit hundreds of couples, including same-sex male couples using a surrogate where one or both have HIV, and those seeking known donation from a friend or relative with HIV. This legislative update reflects the advances made in preventing HIV transmission through fertility treatments and is a significant step in further reducing stigma around HIV.</p><p>Prior to donation, people living with HIV will undergo a series of tests to ensure their gametes are safe to donate. There is currently a requirement for a post donation HIV test for sperm donations, which is not clinically necessary due to the pre-donation tests. We were unable to rectify this issue in this Statutory Instrument without causing significant delays. Our priority is enabling people living with HIV to donate their gametes and start a family, and I will look to bring further legislative changes to remove this requirement in due course.</p><p>Secondly, the regulations will include an updated definition of partner donation. Under current rules, female same-sex couples hoping to conceive via reciprocal IVF must first go through screening for additional infectious diseases and genetic diseases, which can cost over &#163;1,000. Heterosexual couples are not required to undergo this testing.</p><p>This legislation will seek to rectify this disparity in testing requirements and therefore lower costs for treatment. Reciprocal IVF is an increasingly popular way for female couples to have families and this change will help many more couples to afford this treatment.</p><p>We hope that these changes will help to create a fairer health system by removing barriers to accessing fertility care, in line with our commitments in the Women&#8217;s Health Strategy.</p>\",\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"c85.6/1\">It is a pleasure to follow <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Chris Bryant\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/10761\">the hon. Member for Rhondda (Sir Chris Bryant)</phrase>. I think that I agree with most of what he said.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/2\">There is an old joke about asking directions where the answer is, &#8220;Don&#8217;t start from here.&#8221; Given a fair choice, I would not start with the motion in front of us, but I do support the idea that the House should be able to exclude somebody who has been accused of or  charged with a serious offence. That is in the interests of the safety of the people who work here and visit here and of the reputation of the House, so I think I support the principle.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/3\">However, there are various issues with the actual motion we have in front of us. It appears to have been written for a process that should have applied when someone has been accused of something or arrested for something, but has ended up being applied when someone has actually been charged with something. If we were starting from scratch and saying, &#8220;What should we do if a Member is charged with a violent or sexual offence?&#8221; I am not sure we would come up with the process that we have here.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/4\">That was the logic of the amendments that I have tabled, which seek to say that if somebody has actually been charged in that situation, they should just be excluded until that process has been resolved either by the charges being dropped, or by them being acquitted or convicted. It is hard to see, based on the experience we have had of people choosing to self-exclude, that the panel would ever meet and choose not to exclude somebody who had been charged&#8212;that seems extraordinarily unlikely. So what is the advantage of having the panel in that situation? It would only add in some level of discretion and some risk that what is reported in public is that the House thinks this person has been charged with something so serious they have to be excluded, but that somehow we do not think this person is really guilty so they have not been excluded. That would taint the process to no advantage.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/5\">My suggestion is that, if the amendment tabled by <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Wendy Chamberlain\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25872\">the hon. Member for North East Fife (Wendy Chamberlain)</phrase> is not carried, and this process continues to apply solely on charge, we just scrap the panel completely and the person is excluded until the whole process is resolved. That is fairer, neater and more clearly understood and it would be a better situation to have. I wish this process could be a lot quicker and that getting from accusation through to arrest, to charge and to conviction or acquittal did not take a year or two years, because if it did not, this would not be such a significant process. Somebody would be out of Parliament for a few months at most, not a few years. However, that is not the world we appear to live in, and so having clarity, where everybody knows the position, would be better than having the panel.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/6\">I have a few other points. This House appoints Members to the Standards Committee and elects the Chair; what we have here is a more serious process where somebody can be excluded for a very long period, effectively by Members who have not been elected by the House for that purpose. We can argue that when the House selects Deputy Speakers to a very serious position, that is a reasonable part of their role, but I am not sure that the choice to have the third member&#8212;possibly the casting vote&#8212;be a member of the Commission is a sensible one.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/7\">The Commission is formed of a member of the Cabinet, a member of the shadow Cabinet, an SNP-appointed person and then three others appointed by the Government or the Opposition. We have generally tried to steer clear of having the Government exclude Members from Parliament&#8212;I think my right hon. Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Jacob Rees-Mogg\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24926\">the Member for North East Somerset (Sir Jacob Rees-Mogg)</phrase> would strongly agree&#8212;so that was a terrible choice for  who the casting vote might be. It should have been the Liaison Committee, or a member of the Panel of Chairs, or somebody who is senior in the House and has had some kind of endorsement from the House, but is not tainted by being a Government appointee.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/8\">I think that in evidence to the Procedure Committee both the Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House said they would not want to be on the panel in that situation, so now we are down to four members who could do that work. What if one of those members was accused? What if one of them was the victim? How would we form the panel? Perhaps, when we come to review this question in future we could find a better way of doing that.</p><p pid=\"c85.6/9\">My final point is on the proxy vote. It would have been fair enough, if we were applying this process at accusation or arrest, to say, &#8220;Well, somebody may not be guilty or even be charged with this, so to exclude them completely would be the wrong thing to do. Let&#8217;s at least give them their vote.&#8221; We have had a Parliament in recent memory with a very small majority, and an exclusion in such a situation could have changed the result of some votes, so I can see a logic for a proxy vote in that situation. But can anybody really see the logic of a proxy vote for somebody who has been charged?</p><p pid=\"c85.6/10\">We do not give proxy votes for people who are representing this House on other assemblies around the world; we do not give them to people who are on official House Select Committee visits or other official business. That we would give a proxy vote to someone who was in a courtroom, in the dock, on trial for rape, is ridiculous. If we believe acting at the point of charge is right, the Member should be excluded and have effectively no role until their name is cleared. If the hon. Member for North East Fife&#8217;s amendment is not carried, I urge Members to scrap the panel, which adds nothing and makes the situation worse, and not have a proxy vote. I think that would be a terrible tainting of the House&#8217;s reputation.</p>',\n",

Friend <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Grahame Morris\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/24715\">the Member for Easington (Grahame Morris)</phrase> on the work that he did to secure the debate, and for his admirable opening speech.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/2\">According to the excellent report &#8220;The State of the Coalfields 2024&#8221;, commissioned by the Coalfields Regeneration Trust, the former coalfields account for 8% of the population in England, 10% in Scotland and 25% in Wales. That gives us an idea of the scale in Wales &#8212;one in four people there live in a former coalfield area&#8212;and of the importance of today&#8217;s debate.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/3\">Mining has been a dominant part of Welsh life for generations. My grandfather was a miner, my uncle was a miner, and my father was a Bevin boy who was sent down the local pit during the second world war. There were mines across my constituency from the sea on one side to the sea on the other&#8212;Hendy, Llangennech, Bynea, Llwynhendy, Tumble, Cross Hands, Pontyberem, Ponthenri and Pontyates, and in Llanelli itself and Burry Port, with coal being exported from those two busy ports &#8212;and, of course, mining has shaped our politics.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/4\">My predecessor as MP for Llanelli, the great Jim Griffiths, spoke passionately from his own experience of the hardship that he saw in the mining communities in which he was brought up&#8212;the effects of unemployment,  poverty, malnutrition, sickness and industrial injury&#8212;and took up the fight to bring about the reforms that were needed to help those who fell on hard times. He spoke and wrote about &#8220;The Price Wales Pays for Poverty&#8221;: maternal mortality, malnutrition, overcrowding, condemned housing, unemployment, silicosis, and the terrible affliction of tuberculosis. He also highlighted the wealth taken from Wales by coal owners, royalty owners and landlords, and demanded a proper response and resources to deal with the country\\'s problems.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/5\">When serving in the 1945 Labour Government, Jim Griffiths introduced the Family Allowances Act 1945, under which money was paid directly to mothers. He subsequently introduced the National Insurance Act 1946 and an Act close to his heart, the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries) Act, which was very much born out of the suffering and difficulties of injured miners that he had witnessed and which introduced extra benefits for people injured at work. That Act was universal, in that it covered the entire workforce. It provided injury benefit for six months, disability benefit for the permanently injured, and a death benefit for dependants. It also set up tribunals to assess cases, rather than claimants&#8217; having to take on all the responsibility for pushing their own cases.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/6\">Now, some 80 years later and some 40 years on from the miners&#8217; strike, as is documented in the report I mentioned earlier, we have shockingly not eliminated all the problems. There are still high levels of poverty, malnutrition, unemployment and sickness in former mining areas, and there is still much to be done to enable those areas to enjoy the same levels of wealth as others. We know of many of the problems that our former mining communities face, scattered as they are in south Wales up and down steep valleys. Many are in what are now pleasant rural locations, and some contain quite spacious council or former council-owned properties, but their location was clearly intended to be close to the mines where people worked. Now, investors, developers and young people all want to be near the main arteries or in the main towns, and it is so much more difficult to attract inward investment into the more remote mining communities. Furthermore, they are often spread out in different locations along the valley, making it very difficult to provide services, and often there is a considerable distance up or down the valley to get to the most basic of facilities, such as doctors&#8217; surgeries or shops. Nowadays, there are more opportunities for people to work remotely and to set up businesses that use the internet, but some of our mining communities also suffer from inadequate broadband speeds and a poor mobile phone signal.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/7\">I want to highlight some specific problems, starting with my serious concerns about the drop in quality of former miners&#8217; concessionary coal. I have met miners in my area who used to receive good-quality smokeless coal, but now receive very poor-quality coal, which is causing considerable problems and expense. The coal is blocking up chimneys, meaning that people have to get their chimneys swept more often and at additional expense, and the fumes and fine ash that it gives off pose serious health risks. In fact, the smell and the fumes that emerge from chimneys are so bad that they are causing neighbours down the street to complain about the smoke.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/8\">When I looked into this issue, I found that there was not an isolated batch of coal and that the problem is widespread. On contacting Wayne Thomas of the South  Wales NUM, I learned that as stockpiles of anthracite had been run down, coal of an inferior quality was supplied by Russia. Because of the war in Ukraine and the sanctions against Russia, which I fully support, the supply was halted and an alternative source had to be found. I understand that the coal now comes from Peru and is supplied in a chimney- compressed duff, using molasses as a binding agent. The NUM says that such coal gives off a very fine ash, which causes respiratory problem&#8212;obviously not good for ex-miners, many of whom already have breathing problems.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/9\">Across the UK, the complaints are similar to those of former miners in my area, who complain that the smoke from chimneys smells funny and that the coal causes blockages. The NUM has twice met the head of the coal liabilities unit at the Department for Business and Trade to discuss this matter, but there has been no news of any improved source, and better sources must be found. I say to the Minister that miners have worked hard in a difficult and dangerous job, and that they are entitled to receive decent concessionary coal. It is shocking that former miners, many of whom are elderly, are now being given poisonous, poor-quality coal, which gives off fumes and ash that are bad for their health, and which clogs up their chimneys. As a matter of urgency, I beg him to do everything he can to source decent coal for our former miners. It is a Government responsibility.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/10\">Turning to the miners&#8217; pensions, I pay tribute to my hon. Friends the Members for Barnsley East (Stephanie Peacock) and for Bristol North West (Darren Jones) for their work. I hope the Minister is aware of the former BEIS Committee&#8217;s report on the mineworkers pension scheme and its recommendations&#8212;namely, that the 50/50 surplus sharing arrangements should be comprehensively reviewed to ensure that miners get their fair share, and that the &#163;1.2 billion reserve fund should be given back to the pensioners immediately. It is now three years since that report, and former miners are not getting any younger, but there has still not been any action from the Government. I ask the Minister to look again at the scheme, and to ensure that miners get their fair share.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/11\">I turn now to the coal tip legacy. I was a very impressionable small child at the time of the Aberfan coal disaster on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">21 October 1966</phrase>. I was the same age as some of the children buried under the slag heap as it engulfed the school, and I will never forget the images on our black-and-white telly of fathers desperately trying to dig out their children. Following that, we saw the gradual remediation of the tips. Things began to look better and greener, but with the increased frequency of more violent weather events, it is now clear that the job is not done. As we saw all too vividly in the Rhondda a couple of years ago, there is still a lot more work to be done to ensure that the tips are safe.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/12\">This is a legacy from pre-devolution times. The slag heaps were produced as a result of mining coal to fuel the factories that filled the coffers of the UK Treasury, and the UK Government have a responsibility to ensure that every tip in Wales is made safe. We in Carmarthenshire are relatively lucky, with fewer and less risky tips than in the valleys further east, where urgent investment is needed. It was very disappointing that there was no mention of any funding in the spring Budget, and I ask the Minister to take this message back to the Chancellor.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/13\">I turn to Orgreave. On <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">18 June</phrase>, we will mark 40 years since we saw the truly shocking scenes of police attacking miners at Orgreave, and we need a proper inquiry into  what happened that day. It is very disappointing that the Government have not instigated such an inquiry, even after the revelations about South Yorkshire police in Bishop James Jones&#8217;s Hillsborough report. However, we need not only an inquiry into Orgreave, but a proper Hillsborough law. It is not enough for the Government&#8217;s belated response to the Hillsborough report in December last year to espouse the introduction of a voluntary charter, an independent public advocate and a code of ethical policing. Instead, we need a full Hillsborough law to force those in public office to co-operate fully with investigations, and to guarantee fairer funding to enable those affected by a major tragedy to challenge public institutions. I urge the Minister to set up an inquiry into Orgreave, and to adopt a full Hillsborough law.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/14\">I want to say a few words about a just transition to the industries of the future, which is the exact opposite of what we saw in the 1980s, when it was clear that the Thatcher Government wanted to destroy the coal industry. However, it was not just the coal industry that was decimated. We saw the closure of the big steel plant in my constituency and numerous other closures across the country, resulting in areas of mass unemployment, with communities feeling that they had been thrown on the scrapheap. The legacy remains till this day, as documented in the Coalfields Regeneration Trust report.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/15\">It does not have to be like this. Of course we want to make progress and to harness technology to our advantage &#8212;whether it is the spinning mills of the 18th century, motorised transport, robots on the production line, artificial intelligence, the transition from fossil fuels to renewables, or the change from blast furnace steel production to green primary steelmaking&#8212;but it should be a just transition, with training and jobs for workers, and investment in the new green industry of the future. That is why it is so disappointing to see the Government&#8217;s half-hearted approach to the future of the steel industry. We welcome investment in the electric arc furnace, but there is a refusal to think bigger and to invest in the green primary steelmaking of the future, leaving thousands of workers to lose their jobs. It is a devastating blow for Port Talbot and, yet again, the surrounding former coalfield communities.</p><p pid=\"b747.0/16\">We in the Labour party are determined to see a just transition to the industry of the future, with proper investment through our proposed national wealth fund, the upskilling of workers and the creation of quality jobs. Never again do we want to see workers thrown on the scrapheap and communities devastated.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a389.2/1\">My hon. Friend makes a good point, which I will answer straightaway. It is worth emphasising that we are getting better at operating in very contested spaces. For example, he will know of the work that Education Cannot Wait is doing in very difficult circumstances, particularly where people have been forced to move or where there has been migration as a result of violence or climate change. On all these things, we are getting better at serving communities in extreme difficulty, but my hon. Friend raises a very interesting point, and if I have anything further to add on that, I will write to him shortly.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/2\">I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the importance of immunisation for global health. I am also grateful to the hon. Member for Dundee West, who raised a number of interesting points, all of which I think I am going to cover, and to <phrase class=\"honfriend\" name=\"Catherine West\" person_id=\"uk.org.publicwhip/person/25328\">the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green (Catherine West)</phrase>, who speaks on these matters for the Opposition, in particular for the comments that she made about GSK. It is worth pointing out that this is an area where a vital part is played not only by the private sector and the pharmaceutical industry, but by philanthropic organisations, many of which are very concerned with the area. There is no doubt that, as Bill Gates always says, vaccinating children is one of the best value for money interventions that can be made, with the widest and deepest effects. The hon. Lady&#8217;s points about GSK are very welcome indeed.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/3\">The hon. Lady asked me about R&amp;D issues and about higher education, and I will make two points. First, she is absolutely right to emphasise the importance  of the R&amp;D budget. She will have noticed that, during a very difficult period in which cuts&#8212;sometimes very serious cuts&#8212;were made in development spending, the R&amp;D budget has been defended throughout. Indeed, as we have projected forward the draft figures, we have again protected the R&amp;D budget in development, and it will, I think, be rising over the next few years. Like her, I have seen the remarkable work that that budget is doing. In the UK, I recently visited the Jenner Institute and saw the brilliant work that so many are doing there. I agree with the hon. Lady about the importance of R&amp;D.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/4\">Secondly, in relation to spreading British higher education skill into Africa, I point out to the hon. Lady the recently announced programme for the Tropical Health and Education Trust, which I launched in London. THET does a huge amount of good work in this respect. We had an excellent programme some 10 years ago, and I am very pleased indeed that we have been able to renew that.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/5\">All my colleagues who spoke in the debate shone a spotlight on our lifesaving work with partners, including Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance; the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria; and Unitaid. We see strong support in every part of the House for those lifesaving efforts, and I am very grateful for the contributions of Members here today in that respect.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/6\">I will endeavour to respond to all the points raised, but first I want to make a point specifically about Gavi, which I was asked about by the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall. He will, I think, recall that in 2011, when I had the privilege of being the International Development Secretary, we did the Gavi replenishment in London, and there has been a subsequent replenishment since that time. The point that I want to make to him is that that pivotal replenishment in 2011 was very heavily supported. Incidentally, we know that 83% of the British public thought that spending taxpayers&#8217; money on vaccinating children under five in the developing world should be supported; they showed approval for that. I thought that was a very encouraging statistic then, and I have hopes for the upcoming replenishment, on which I wish to assure the hon. Gentleman. I cannot put a figure on the table now, but both I and the Foreign Secretary are very focused on the replenishment, because we know the good that this work does, which the hon. Gentleman so eloquently set out. We will undoubtedly be key supporters of the replenishment when we make our contribution.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/7\">I was also asked about the Global Fund. If I may say so, I thought that the hon. Member for Dundee West was a little unfair in criticising the figure. It was the first significant pledge when I returned to the Government in October 2022; we managed to get the system to agree. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer was very keen on spending the money on the Global Fund, as was the Prime Minister, who emphasised the importance of the work, and &#163;1 billion&#8212;a thousand million pounds&#8212;of taxpayers&#8217; money is not to be sniffed at. If the hon. Member for Dundee West looks at what Peter Sands, the chief executive of the Global Fund, said at the time and subsequently about Britain&#8217;s support, both financial and in many other ways, I am sure that his spirits will be lifted.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/8\">In respect of the pandemic accord negotiations, which the hon. Member also mentioned, although I have nothing to say today, I think that they are proceeding well. The British Government have spent a great deal of time on that this week, and I hope that when the  announcements are made in due course by Tedros from the WHO, the hon. Gentleman will be pleased and relieved at what we are able to achieve.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/9\">Vaccines have saved more than 150 million lives over the last 50 years, including more than 100 million children. That is six lives saved every minute for five decades. I am sure that we can all agree that this is one of humanity&#8217;s greatest achievements. The UK&#8217;s support for childhood vaccinations around the world has played its part, together with institutions including the World Health Organisation, Gavi, the Global Fund and Unitaid. However, the covid pandemic threatened to undo our hard-won progress, sparking the largest reversal in child vaccination rates in three decades and leading to increased outbreaks and deaths. Although vaccination rates have recovered since, global health is, as with everything, bound up with geopolitics. We stand at a crucial juncture in that respect. In these increasingly challenging times, we can only maintain our progress on global vaccines by uniting forces and standing together to ensure the health of future generations.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/10\">Let me be clear: reaching the world&#8217;s children with vaccination remains a top priority for Britain, as set out so clearly in our widely endorsed international development White Paper. We are determined to enhance our partnerships with individual countries and strengthen our collaborations with organisations such as Gavi, which will help continue to save countless lives.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/11\">The UK has supported Gavi since its inception 24 years ago. By bringing together Governments, private sector foundations, civil society organisations and vaccine manufacturers, it has vaccinated&#8212;that is to say, Britain has vaccinated&#8212;more than 1 billion children, saving more than 17 million lives. I am glad to say that Britain was one of the six original donors, and it hosted Gavi&#8217;s most successful summits, in 2011 and then in 2020, when we committed &#163;1.65 billion over five years. Later that year, at the UN General Assembly, we pledged an additional &#163;548 million to the Gavi COVAX advance market commitment to support lower income countries with covid vaccines.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/12\">We are now looking ahead, working closely with Gavi to develop a strong strategy for the next five years. That includes reaching all children with routine immunisations, and better integrating that with primary healthcare services. We want to improve co-ordination with other global health institutions to ensure that programmes are sustainable and, most importantly, led by countries themselves.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/13\">We are also looking ahead to the gathering hosted by the French Government, the African Union and Gavi this summer in Paris. President Macron will launch an accelerator mechanism to help African vaccine manufacturers produce vaccines in Africa and become commercially sustainable on a long-term basis. The UK looks forward to announcing the details of our support for that work, demonstrating the importance we place on a united global effort to improve access to vaccines and better prepare for future health emergencies. Those are all things that I have discussed in detail with Akinwumi Adesina, the president of the African Development Bank.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/14\">The roll-out of the malaria vaccines, which were referred to, not least by the hon. Member for Hornsey and Wood Green, highlights the role the UK has already  played in end-to-end support of innovation vaccines. First, working in collaboration with partners in India, our world-leading scientists helped to develop these game-changing new vaccines, which must be used in combination with bed nets and chemoprotection. Then, supported by UK funding, Gavi, the Global Fund, Unitaid and the World Health Organisation set up pilots to provide the evidence necessary for a wider roll-out, and Britain&#8217;s MedAccess, so brilliantly led by Michael Anderson, worked with Gavi to secure the vaccine supply.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/15\">The vaccine roll-out will protect more than 6 million children from malaria by the end of next year. This is the first time that Gavi and the Global Fund will be working together on a single disease, and it presents a wonderful opportunity to strengthen their efforts even further. The wider work to prevent and treat diseases such as malaria, HIV and TB is also helping to save countless lives.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/16\">Britain was a founding donor to Unitaid 20 years ago, and has contributed more than half a billion pounds over the years. Today, more than 170 million people benefit from health products supported by Unitaid every year, from the latest HIV treatments to next-generation mosquito nets. Two weeks ago, on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">24 April</phrase>, I was delighted to join a parliamentary reception hosted by Unitaid, at which I reiterated Britain&#8217;s firm support for it.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/17\">Another great example of our investment in cutting-edge research and development is the recent deployment in Nigeria of the innovative MenFive vaccine. That revolutionary new shot is a powerful shield against the five major strains of the bacteria that cause meningitis. The research into MenFive was funded by Britain and developed through a partnership between PATH&#8212;a global non-profit organisation&#8212;and the Serum Institute of India. The roll-out of 1 million vaccines in northern Nigeria came from Gavi-funded stocks approved by the World Health Organisation last year. MenFive will be rolled out in other countries&#8212;Niger is expected to start vaccinating imminently&#8212;giving a big boost to our work to end meningitis globally by the end of the decade. That is exactly the kind of scientific innovation that Britian will continue to support, driving further break- throughs that will help to wipe out other preventable diseases.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/18\">While we are speaking of the future, let me turn to the matter of replenishments for our partners for the next 12 months, including Gavi, the Global Fund and the World Health Organisation. As I confirmed in my opening remarks, we are considering how and where our funding can have the greatest impact, and we look forward to announcing our contributions at the replenishment events.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/19\">I hope I have done justice to the work that Britain has done with our partners, which has saved countless lives. Those collaborations and scientific breakthroughs have enabled us to eradicate smallpox, and&#8212;thank goodness &#8212;we are on the verge of eradicating polio, which the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall raised. Children around the world are now protected against 19 deadly diseases through routine immunisation via Gavi.</p><p pid=\"a389.2/20\">There is, of course, more to do, and we will keep up the momentum. Nobody should die of a preventable illness, and everyone, everywhere should have access to these wonderful innovations. That is how we build a healthier and fairer world for all.</p>',\n",

It has been about 18 months since I led a members&#8217; business debate on the chronic challenges and industrial action that we see in Scotland&#8217;s college sector.\\n    </p><p>\\n     The Scottish Greens believe that colleges have a critical role to play in building a fairer, greener Scotland and in delivering the key priorities that we can all agree on, such as the climate action that is required to reach our net zero targets and the eradication of child poverty, which the First Minister has just reaffirmed as his priority for his new Government. Education is both a social and an individual good. It can be genuinely transformational for people&#8217;s lives.\\n    </p><p>\\n     We should not pretend that a good education can simply undo all the structural inequalities that we face in society. That places far too much burden on teachers, college and university lecturers. However, it is a key ingredient in a successful society. By &#8220;successful society&#8221;, I do not mean a society that defines its success by gross domestic product wealth or even by average incomes, although that is an important measure. A successful society is one that is collectively able to meet the needs of every individual and to give every opportunity for a happy, healthy life.\\n    </p><p>\\n     The ability of colleges to play a critical role in doing that has been held back in the past decade by chronic problems in industrial relations. It is a clear example of class inequality that it has gone on for so long, with so little attention relative to the much shorter bouts of industrial action that we have seen in schools and universities, which have garnered far more political and media attention.\\n    </p><p>\\n     What would the Scottish Greens do differently? How do we believe that we can break out of this cycle? For a start, we would apply stricter fair work conditions to the funding of colleges, policies such as the elimination of zero-hours contracts and the implementation of pay ratios to demonstrate, particularly to the lowest-paid college staff and to support staff, that efforts are being made to improve their conditions. We want to see far more enforcement of fair work conditions, whether it be the national conditions that we would like the SFC to set out or local fair work agreements that are reached between college management and unions on an individual college basis. The Funding Council&#8217;s evaluation of that element of the outcome agreements seems almost non-existent, frankly. Fair work policies are worthless if they are not being enforced by the body that has the power to do so&#8212;the body that controls the purse strings.\\n    </p><p>\\n     I am proud that college boards must now include at least two trade union representatives. That was delivered by the Scottish Greens in our time in government. However, I believe that college governance requires far more strengthening than that. Consideration should be given to the appointment of reserved spaces for local councillors, for example, to ensure that there is a stronger connection between colleges and the communities that they are in, and better co-ordination between colleges and councils, which are two sets of bodies that are obviously key for local economic development.\\n    </p><p>\\n     We also need to address issues that arise where individual boards are not providing sufficient scrutiny. We have clearly seen that with City of Glasgow College, where the proximity of the senior management to the board, in particular the chair, has corroded effective scrutiny and workforce confidence. It is hard for staff to stomach lectures on fiscal constraint from principals who are paid more than the First Minister. We need to see college principals brought into the public sector pay strategy, in particular the chief executive pay framework.\\n    </p><p>\\n     The Scottish Government needs to respond to the recommendations in the Strathesk Resolutions &#8220;Lessons Learned&#8221; report. If we are to break out of the cycle, we need to ensure that all sides come out of their comfort zone and consider recommendations that may not be their preference but would provide something of a route forward.\\n    </p><p>\\n     I want to see the restoration of the &#163;26 million that was initially allocated by the Greens for transformation in our college sector. I understand why that money was reallocated&#8212;it was to fulfil the needs of the teacher pay deal, with which I was involved, so I recognise that&#8212;but it absolutely needs to go back into our college sector. It is not good enough for MSPs from parties that voted against increasing tax on the top 5 per cent in order to mitigate cuts to simply demand more money. It is incumbent on all parties in this place, in particular now that we have entered a period of minority government, to come forward with credible tax and spend proposals.\\n    </p><p>\\n     I want to see more funding for our college sector and my party is prepared to detail where we would get that from. For the sake of college staff, students and wider society, it is incumbent on all parties, and all MSPs, to bring forward credible proposals at the upcoming round of budget negotiations so that we can play our part in breaking the cycle.\\n    </p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"b1966.0/1\">My Lords, I am grateful to have the opportunity at last to ask some questions about this Statement, because the route here has not been pretty or swift. The Prime Minister made a speech on <phrase class=\"date\" code=\"\">19 April</phrase> about the need to reform sickness and disability benefits. Cue lots of headlines about sick note culture and the need for a crackdown. Then, there was silence: 10 days of expecting a Statement which did not come; 10 days of asking for detail; 10 days during which, if noble Lords are anything like  me, they will have had a succession of messages from sick and disabled people who were very anxious about what was going to happen to their benefits.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/2\">When the Secretary of State finally talked, it was not to Parliament but to the media, of course, so we began to find details there. The Telegraph ran the headline, &#8220;Disability benefits could be vouchers, not cash&#8221;. The Sunday Times said, &#8220;Depressed and anxious face losing &#8230; benefits&#8221;, with the sub-headline, &#8220;Tories plan welfare reform as election divide&#8221;. I sorry to say it, but there we have it. The Secretary of State was quoted in the Sunday Times as saying that</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1966.0/3\">&#8220;it was &#8216;extraordinary&#8217; that Labour was refusing to say whether it supported his benefit changes&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/4\">At this point, there was no document, there had been no Statement in Parliament, and no details were available. In fact, when the Statement was made in Parliament, the Secretary of State did not even observe the usual courtesies of giving an advance copy to the Speaker and the shadow Secretary of State. I do not know why the Government would sit on the Statement and document for 10 days and then publish them in the week of the crucial local elections&#8212;it is a mystery.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/5\">Now we have the details, although it is not very detailed. I read the Green Paper from cover to cover, and if you exclude questions and the padding in the annexes, there are 14 pages of content. The Green Paper could hardly be any lighter green.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/6\">How did we get here? In 2013, the Government abolished disability living allowance and created PIP. According to the Green Paper:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1966.0/7\">&#8220;PIP was intended to differ from DLA by being fairer (by paying greater regard to needs arising from mental health, sensory and cognitive conditions)&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/8\">It was also to be</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1966.0/9\">&#8220;more consistent &#8230; objective &#8230; transparent &#8230; sustainable &#8230; modern and dynamic&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/10\">The Government committed to undertake an independent review of PIP after two years and again two years later. There have been two consultations covering PIP since then.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/11\">Then, in July 2021, the Government published Shaping future support: the health and disability green paper, which launched a consultation on PIP and ESA. Nearly two years later, in March 2023, the Government published a health and disability White Paper which set out the Government&#8217;s vision</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1966.0/12\">&#8220;to help more disabled people and people with health conditions to start, stay and succeed in work&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/13\">That paper announced the plan to remove the existing universal credit limited capability for work and work-related activity element and replace it with a new universal credit health element. It was also going to abolish the work capability assessment, which was people&#8217;s gateway to those benefits, so there would be only one health and disability functional test in future: the PIP assessment.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/14\">Now, a year after that White Paper, we are back to a Green Paper, which proposes abolishing the PIP assessment. What is going on? How will anyone be assessed for anything? Will the Minister tell us what happens to people who are clearly too sick to work at the moment but are not disabled? How will they have  their support assessed when there is neither a work capability assessment nor a PIP assessment? Is the plan still to have a new universal credit health element, or is that under consideration again as well? The Government suggest that some health conditions can be taken out of PIP assessments. Can the Minister tell us which conditions they have in mind? PIP is also passport to the carer&#8217;s allowance. How will that work if there is no PIP assessment? Do people risk losing their benefits and their personal care from family or friends at the same time?</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/15\">The Government said that DLA was the problem and PIP was the answer; now it seems that PIP is the problem. The fact is that we have a problem in this country: we have a record 2.8 million people locked out of work due to long-term sickness. But what or who is to blame? How much of that is down to the Government\\'s record on the NHS? When the Statement was debated in the Commons, the chair of the Work and Pensions Select Committee pointed out that:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1966.0/16\">&#8220;PIP assessment providers confirm that worsening delays in NHS treatment are a big factor in the increase in the number of people applying for PIP&#8221;.&#8212;[Official Report, Commons, 29/4/24; col. 52.]</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/17\">We have also been hearing strong hints that the real problem is people with mental health problems. I do not doubt the Minister on this, but politicians in general need to be very careful about how we speak about mental health, for risk of stigmatising people or making them afraid to speak out or seek help. Can the Minister say whether the Government&#8217;s plans involve treating people&#8217;s mental and physical health differently? If so, can he explain the legal basis for making such a distinction? Can he also say what the Government will do about the near impossibility, for many people, of getting any timely mental health support at the moment?</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/18\">A Labour Government would take a different approach. Among those who need the help of the state, there are some people who are temporarily or, in some cases, permanently unable to work and who need support to have a decent life. There are many others who need extra help to get, keep and advance in a job, and it is the state&#8217;s job to give that to them. For those people, health and work are two sides of the same coin.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/19\">Rather than blaming people for being sick, a Labour Government will support our NHS. The last Labour Government delivered the highest patient satisfaction level on record, and that is the record on which we want to build. We will drive down NHS waiting lists by getting patients treated on time, with 2 million more weekend and evening appointments, and we will ensure more support for those with mental health problems through an extra 8,500 mental health staff.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/20\">We will focus constructively on work, the other side of that coin, because the costs of failure in this area are a disaster for individuals and the country. Where it is possible, work is good for us&#8212;for our mental and physical health. Labour will have a new deal for working people, improving rights for the first time in a generation. We will drive up employment in every region, devolve employment support and end the tick-box culture in jobcentres. We will tear down the barriers to work for disabled people and provide help for young people.</p><p pid=\"b1966.0/21\">Labour will carefully review the issues raised by this latest Green Paper. Clearly, sick and disabled people need appropriate help and support, but we also want to be a country where disabled people have the same right to a good job and the help to get it as anyone else. We will judge any measure that the Government bring forward on its merits and against that principle. I look forward hearing more from the Minister.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"b1919.0/1\">My Lords, I support Amendment 92 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Taylor of Stevenage, and explained so well by the noble Lord, Lord Khan of Burnley. The right to manage was first introduced in the leasehold reform Act of 2002. From the start, it was, as the noble Lord said, intended as a simple and cost-effective alternative to collective enfranchisement, but, despite the happy intentions of that Act, the reality was quite different. Take-up has not been what we would all have hoped for or expected, because the right to manage has proved incredibly problematic in practice.</p><p pid=\"b1919.0/2\">These problems culminated in the Law Commission&#8217;s final report in 2020&#8212;time has marched on&#8212;on exercising the right to manage. It summarises the difficulties as follows:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1919.0/3\">&#8220;The &#8216;simple&#8217; RTM process envisaged in the original consultation which led to the 2002 Act has not come to pass. The requirement for strict compliance with the statutory procedures, such as the service of certain notices on particular parties, can be unforgiving to leaseholders. In many cases, small mistakes made by the RTM company have afforded landlords opportunities to frustrate or delay otherwise valid claims. The Court of Appeal has noted that while the procedures &#8216;should be as simple as possible to reduce the potential for challenges by an obstructive landlord&#8217;, in fact they &#8216;contain traps for the unwary&#8217;&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1919.0/4\">This is not a good advert for anyone seeking to exercise the right to manage, which we believe is fundamental to the change we need. The Law Commission subsequently made 101 recommendations, of which the then Government adopted two.</p><p pid=\"b1919.0/5\">Whole swathes of actions could be happening to make this process simpler and to encourage residents to take this up. We have no doubt that the process is not an easy one and that the provisions in the Bill as it stands are actually quite limited. The uplift from 25% to 50% is welcome, as are the beneficial changes in cost provision, and minor changes to courts and tribunals. They are all positive but underwhelming&#8212;a far cry from the 101 recommendations.</p><p pid=\"b1919.0/6\">In debates throughout the course of the Bill we have heard numerous instances of excessive charges and unfair practices, from both Houses. The Law Commission summed it up best when it said that</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"b1919.0/7\">&#8220;the landlord and leaseholder have opposing financial interests&#8212;generally speaking, any financial gain for the landlord will be at the expense of the leaseholder, and vice versa &#8230;Their interests are diametrically opposed, and consensus will be impossible to achieve&#8221;.</p><p pid=\"b1919.0/8\">This amendment is quite realistic: it is starting only with new build, but what it does is symbolic, in that it draws a line under the past and clearly points the way forward. Noble Lords will notice that I am not wearing rose-coloured spectacles, and we are not saying that the residents&#8217; right to manage will be any easier&#8212;but it will be fairer. Those paying the bills control the bills and can remove any poorly performing providers. We believe that a leaseholder-controlled resident management company with an elected board, accountable to all leaseholders, is a far more democratic arrangement than one middleman freeholder controlling block management, spending leaseholders&#8217; money freely and  not involving them in the decision-making processes. It is fundamentally a better way to go, and there seems to be widespread support for it.</p><p pid=\"b1919.0/9\">We support this amendment because we believe that it is a step in the right direction and could reinvigorate right to manage with the right support. It seems that the Government are finding reasons not to do something instead of working to enable something better to happen.</p>',\n",

       "   'body': \"<p>I'd like to start by thanking the Petitions Committee Chair, Jack Sargeant, for opening such an important debate and all those who took part in the evidence sessions. I think all Members across this Chamber recognise the complex issues that exist around utility bills and that this is complicated by the application of prepayment meters. Whilst there are households and groups that are particularly vulnerable and need assistance with paying their bills, there are also households and individuals who can adequately afford their electricity and gas bills, who, for one reason or another, choose not to pay them and instead run up high debt.</p><p>Whilst this may not seem problematic for some, because their view is that utility companies can easily weather this loss of income, what it actually means is that that loss is pushed on to other bill payers, who end up subsidising those who refuse to pay. Therefore, there is still a need for prepayment meters and, in some cases, the need for prepayment meters to be mandatory.</p><p>There is evidence that prepayment meters can be an effective way of helping to manage household budgets, especially for those living in shared accommodation or temporary rented accommodation, because it reduces the administration of setting up new accounts for short periods. But, as we all know, one of the major issues with this and with prepayment meters is that they traditionally, as we&#8217;ve heard, then charge a far higher tariff than direct debits.</p><p>As such, I&#8217;m pleased to see that the UK Government, as of July last year, have now enforced the scrapping of prepayment meter premiums by energy companies, and I think this is a big step forward in promoting a fairer and more just system. I do think, Dirprwy Lywydd, as the report points out, that, despite this, there needs to be a more thorough understanding of an individual&#8217;s vulnerability before prepayment meters are installed. I know that utility companies are fully aware of the needs of vulnerable customers and have made considerable efforts to understand vulnerability and put into place services to help meet those needs. However, it was fundamentally wrong of them to involuntarily install meters during a time of huge inflationary pressure from the COVID pandemic and the war in Ukraine, because they were fully aware that many of their customers would have been vulnerable and struggling to pay.</p><p>On average, Dirprwy Lywydd, it takes about two years before people facing financial difficulty come forward to seek help. And during this time, they often make poorer financial decisions out of desperation, and this can impact their mental and physical health. We also know that vulnerability can be transient, whereby people are vulnerable for short periods of time, such as after a bereavement or job loss. And therefore, I wholeheartedly believe that we should be making efforts to reduce, and indeed eliminate, the stigma that people can feel with regards to their vulnerability, and there needs to be more awareness of how they can access support.</p><p>From a personal perspective, I believe that there is considerable merit in energy companies developing a system that can override prepayment meters in times of vulnerability and supply electricity and gas to customers, such as households with children or elderly people, during cold weather and winter months. And this, in the grand scheme of things, would be unlikely to cost utility companies that much. I would be interested to know whether or not companies have considered that option, because it could benefit a lot of people in Wales.</p><p>I&#8217;m glad to see that the Government has accepted all of the recommendations of the report either fully or in principle, and I believe that it is right that the utility companies and Ofgem are continually pushed on this issue, because, in truth, it is not an issue that I think will ever go away. We will always have people with these needs in our country.</p><p>Finally, I would like to mention recommendation 3, one that I fully support. One of the major issues that vulnerable people face is having to retell their experiences and circumstances to multiple organisations, and it would be a great benefit to both them and the utility providers if they only had to explain the situation once. I understand that water companies have done a considerable amount of work with regards to sharing priority registers and that there have been successful trials between water companies and energy providers in sharing this data. I am also aware, however, that there are limitations in terms of general data protection regulation and data sharing and, of course, in protecting that information from being abused. But, nevertheless, I do believe that this really is the way forward in helping the most vulnerable in our society and I&#8217;m glad to see the Welsh Government recognise this, and I would be pleased to see more effort from the Government in pushing for this from companies operating in Wales. Thank you.</p>\",\n",

       "   'body': '<p pid=\"a86.2/1\">I beg to move,</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a86.2/2\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">That this House has considered public understanding of life sentences.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/3\">It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Mark. I welcome this opportunity to discuss crime and justice, one of the topics that motivated me to enter politics and that I have focused on in my time as an MP. As the son of a policeman, and having spent time volunteering as a special constable, I am acutely aware of the way that crime can destroy families and upend the lives of decent, law-abiding people. Wanting the victims of crime and their families to benefit from a more just justice system is something that I feel passionately about. I always aim to contribute to the debate and to edge the system in a direction that I think better delivers the justice that it should be set up to deliver. I have spoken before in this place about my concern that all too often the victims of the most serious crimes and their families do not see justice done.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/4\">Before I speak about the use of the term &#8220;life sentences&#8221; specifically, I will set out the background. My time campaigning in this area has taught me that there is what I have described previously as &#8220;intellectual snobbery&#8221; about people who think that our justice system is at times insufficiently punitive. There are well-meaning and in many respects important groups that lobby hard to make the system less punitive, and nothing that I believe invalidates their arguments or counteracts efforts to deliver reform and rehabilitation of offenders. If such efforts work and overall there are fewer victims of crime, that will be a good thing, but as a Conservative, I believe that we should keep one eye on reality as well as one eye on the ideal future. Criminal behaviour is not going anywhere any time soon, and even the best rehabilitative systems see recalcitrant and very serious offenders.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/5\">Also, we have to recognise that, in and of itself, punishing offenders is a public good; in fact, it is recognised in the law as one of the purposes of sentencing. Whether we like to admit it or not, it helps victims and their family and friends to feel that justice has been done, and in the aftermath of a serious crime, whatever comfort we can bring to victims&#8217; families is incredibly important. I would argue that punishment is fundamental to our system. It tells victims and their families that they should not take matters into their own hands, because the justice system will deal with things fairly.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/6\">Of course, there are no black-and-white answers stating what that will mean in every case, but almost nobody who argues for less punitive measures would suggest, for example, that a murderer&#8212;even one who we could guarantee would not offend again&#8212;should spend just four weeks in prison. Nearly everyone accepts that punishment is necessary, and it is easy to suggest outcomes that 99% of people would agree instinctively are too lenient.  In the most serious cases, there is in my view a huge&#8212;indeed yawning&#8212;gap between what most fair-minded people would think constitutes justice and what actually happens.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/7\">I am also concerned that the Department itself&#8212;the Ministry of Justice&#8212;does not sufficiently engage with this issue. That engagement is sometimes missing from impact assessments and policy changes, and perhaps even more worrying is its absence from the MOJ&#8217;s own annual report. The focus is on victims&#8217; experiences of the processes of the justice system, which is of course important and to be welcomed, but I think that what most victims and their families want most of all is for justice to be done, and the MOJ has little to say on whether or not the justice system as it stands is actually delivering that. I have suggested before that we could start by at least asking people what they think about this issue, but there has been little appetite for that.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/8\">I will never forget what the father of Sarah Everard said when the murderer of his child was sentenced to a whole-life order&#8212;a very rare thing in our justice system. He said that it was the only thing that brought him any comfort. I do not think that he would have felt any different if the perpetrator had not been a policeman, even though it was only because the perpetrator was a policeman that a whole-life order was given. I believe that the view that father expressed is common among the families of murder victims.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/9\">Because this is a subjective issue, I think that the views of victims&#8217; families and the public at large should act as a powerful and important standard against which we hold ourselves, albeit it should not be the only consideration. I remember discussing this question with Elsie Urry, a lady whose three children were brutally murdered in 1973 by a man who she thought was then sent to prison for the rest of his life, only for him to be released in 2019 when he was considered to be no longer a danger to others.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/10\">That brings me on to the use of the term &#8220;life sentence&#8221;. The first thing we need is transparency about what our justice system is actually delivering. Without it, the public do not necessarily know what is happening, and if they do not know what is happening, politicians will not be held to account properly, which is very unfortunate in a democracy. The focus of my debate is to highlight the fact that, in the current system, what is happening is frequently misreported and misunderstood, giving the impression that our justice system is more punitive than it is, particularly when it comes to the most serious offences.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/11\">What is called a life sentence is in fact, in sentencing practice&#8212;a sentence of a minimum term of imprisonment, after which there is an opportunity for release with the remainder of the offender&#8217;s life spent on licence. But what is actually reported? What do the public get told? I was pleased to be able to explore this issue in more depth in the Justice Committee&#8217;s report, &#8220;Public opinion and understanding of sentencing&#8221;, which states:</p><p class=\"indent\" pid=\"a86.2/12\" pwmotiontext=\"yes\">&#8220;The use by major news outlets of the phrase &#8220;jailed for life&#8221; when they are not referring to a whole life order is an example of how media coverage risks perpetuating misunderstandings of the law on life sentences among the public. Reporting of sentencing that potentially inflates expectations of how long a person will serve in prison risks damaging public confidence.&#8221;</p><p pid=\"a86.2/13\">A whole-life order is a term of lifelong imprisonment; it is different from a life sentence.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/14\">Since late last year, my office has regularly monitored this issue, and I am afraid that it is not just the media that spreads this misunderstanding. Even more concerning is the fact that police forces and, on one occasion, the Crown Prosecution Service have incorrectly used the phrase &#8220;jailed for life&#8221; to describe a life sentence. Just today, Nottinghamshire police force released a statement with a headline saying that two murderers had been &#8220;jailed for life&#8221;. That is simply not true. The two individuals had received life sentences with minimum terms of 16 and 19 years. That is very different from being jailed for life, as we can reasonably expect both of them to be released.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/15\">Since October 2023, we have had to contact eight police forces for using the phrase &#8220;jailed for life&#8221; in their headlines about 13 cases. On six occasions, the police forces in their opening paragraphs failed even to explain the minimum tariff set by the courts, and once a police force failed entirely to mention that there was a minimum tariff. I am pleased to say that three police forces admitted their mistake and subsequently changed their statements after we contacted them, but the majority have not. That matters. People do not always read all the details of a news article, let alone of an official press release from a police force. Every time &#8220;jailed for life&#8221; is used of someone subject to a life sentence, people get a false impression of what is happening.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/16\">I do not want to diminish the many positive things that this Government have done to introduce what I think are fairer punitive elements into the system, not least the big step change away from Labour&#8217;s halfway early release to a two-thirds release for the worst offenders, and the introduction of a whole-life order for premeditated child murder. I welcome the planned introduction of whole-life orders when there is a single victim whose murder involved sexual or sadistic conduct, instead of the existing requirement for two victims.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/17\">There is much for me to welcome, but I am clear that we must go further on child murder. I think the requirement for significant premeditation is too high a burden, as it excludes, for example, a parent battering their own child to death in a rage. In addition, where multiple offences are involved, our system is too quick to have sentences served concurrently. We have seen this in cases of historical child sex abuse, where there are sometimes dozens of victims and hundreds of offences. Measures need to be in place to impose whole-life orders in some cases of that type.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/18\">Such changes are difficult to make. They are expensive changes for the Government, and there is always pressure on prison places. We can hope for success only if people understand how rarely whole-life orders are used, and that life sentences are not in any way comparable, especially given the usual minimum terms. If most people serving a life sentence did in fact spend most or all of the rest of their life in prison, this would be less pressing, but they do not. On average, they serve 20 years.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/19\">Some people will argue that the term &#8220;life sentence&#8221; is accurate because it describes the rest of an offender&#8217;s life being served on licence. When we make that argument, however, we risk offending the victims and their families. Families of victims of murder are really serving a life sentence of grief, trauma, and terrible memories of what happened to their loved one. Someone serving their sentence on licence out in the community is basically just being asked to do what all of us are asked to do,  which is to not offend. That is a burden that we all face, and I do not see it as in any way equivalent to spending time in prison. None of this is an issue for those familiar with legal jargon, but when a member of the public who is less well informed of what the terminology means reads &#8220;jailed for life&#8221;, they are being misled.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/20\">I am aware of an almost diametrically opposed view of the public understanding of sentencing, though. A commonly made argument is that, broadly, away from the issue of what a life sentence means, the public underestimate sentencing lengths and think we are less punitive than we are. That is undoubtedly driven by media reporting, where journalists, who have a good innate sense of what the public will think is reasonable, are quick to report cases where they sense that that has not happened. Often, however, an unjustified logical step is made by advocates of less punitive approaches: that because of that, we do not need to make the system more punitive. That approach forgets that two things can be true at the same time: people can think our system is less punitive than it is, but they can also think, even when presented with the reality, that it is not punitive enough.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/21\">There is another argument based on research in which the public are asked to go through more detailed theoretical cases and sentencing exercises. Studies suggest that people agree with the sentences normally given when they have the full picture. However, almost universally, these exercises look at less serious offending and cases that are full of mitigating circumstances. My focus has always been on the worst and most serious offending. I do not think I have ever seen one of these exercises take someone through the case, for example, of a serial rapist in and out of prison who refuses to engage in behavioural change programs, or of a parent who batters, tortures, neglects and then murders their own child. That leaves me still firmly of the view that, in the most serious cases, the problem of misreporting remains important.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/22\">There are things we can do about this. First, as part of the Justice Committee&#8217;s inquiry into the public understanding of sentencing, the Committee travelled to Finland and the Netherlands to speak to officials and stakeholders about how they approached reporting sentencing to the public, including the role of media or press judges engaging with the media on reports. The press judges undertake their media duties in addition to their role as a judge, so that when a sentence is handed down, communication with the media is managed by a press judge rather than the sentencing judge. I was not able to be there, but I know the Committee heard that press judges actively engage with the media on public interest cases in particular, even participating in interviews. Committee members also visited the Helsinki District Court, where judges were encouraged to write their own press notices following the passing of a sentence, in order to take the news into their own hands. As a result, early reports on a sentence were often based upon the judge&#8217;s press notice, ensuring greater accuracy in initial media accounts of the sentencing decision. That is something we could consider.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/23\">Ultimately, we have to accept that the term &#8220;life sentence&#8221; is at the root of the problem. It is too easily misunderstood and therefore too easily misreported. If terminology is causing a problem, we should change it. We just do not need the term. The judiciary can describe and report what they are doing: passing a minimum  term with an opportunity for future release, followed by continuous monitoring on licence. I do not expect extinguishing the term to cause an overnight change. The media and public bodies are used to using it and &#8220;jailed for life&#8221; is a catchy headline, but over time we could see a change and have a more honest understanding of our judicial system.</p><p pid=\"a86.2/24\">It may be that I and those who share my views have no more success in making the case for changes on the matter of substance&#8212;the sentences actually being served&#8212;but at least we will be making that case in a more honest environment. I am arguing for transparency in sentencing, because I know that that is important to victims of crime and their families, and to the public. I hope the Minister sees the value in that, and will reflect on what I have said and try to find a positive way forward.</p>',\n",

The Progress in International Reading Study (PIRLS) 2021 showed that English primary school children are the best in the western world and were ranked 4<sup>th</sup> out of 43 comparable countries. While the pandemic affected the study, the Programme for International School Assessment 2022 also showed that 15 year old pupils in England performed above the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and development (OECD) average and are now 11<sup>th</sup> in maths and 13<sup>th</sup> in reading and science. This was up from 27<sup>th</sup> in maths, 25<sup>th</sup> in reading and 16<sup>th</sup> in science in 2009.</p><p>The department has invested significantly to provide a world class education system, ensuring an excellent teacher for every child, high standards of curriculum attendance and behaviour, targeted support for every child that needs it and a stronger and fairer schools system. The overall core schools budget, including the recently announced additional pensions funding, will total &#163;60.7 billion in 2024/25, which is the highest ever level in real terms per pupil. This means school funding will have risen by &#163;11 billion by 2024/25 compared to 2021/22.</p><p>The funding breakdown requested since 2019/20 is included below. Figures for the 2023/24 financial year are subject to ongoing data collection and reconciliation and therefore we have not included this year in the table. The department reviews Initial Teacher Training (ITT) bursaries each year to determine the offer for trainees starting ITT the following academic year. In doing this, the department takes into account a number of factors including historic recruitment, forecast economic conditions and teacher supply need in each subject. The department focuses its funded Subject Knowledge Enhancement (SKE) courses in its highest priority subjects with the greatest sufficiency challenges.</p><p>In addition to the funding outlined in the table below, the department also offers national professional qualifications (NPQs), including specialist NPQs in leading literacy and leading primary mathematics. Details on scholarship funding available for autumn 2024 is available here: <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-national-professional-qualifications-npqs\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/guidance/funding-for-national-professional-qualifications-npqs</a>.</p><p>The quality of teaching is the single most important, in-school factor for improving pupil outcomes and it is particularly important for pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds. The department is creating a world-class teacher development system, which builds from ITT, through to early career support, specialisation and onto school leadership.</p><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p><strong>Financial year</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>2019/20</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>2020/21</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>2021/22</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>2022/23</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Subject Knowledge Enhancement Courses<sup>1</sup></p></td><td><p>&#163;28m</p></td><td><p>&#163;24m</p></td><td><p>&#163;14m</p></td><td><p>&#163;10m</p></td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><p>Oak National Academy resources<sup>2</sup></p></td><td><p>N/A</p></td><td><p>&#163;4m</p></td><td><p>&#163;4m</p></td><td><p>&#163;7m</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"4\"><p>Subject hubs<sup>3</sup></p></td><td><p>English Hubs</p></td><td><p>&#163;11m</p></td><td><p>&#163;11m</p></td><td><p>&#163;19m</p></td><td><p>&#163;24m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Maths Hubs</p></td><td><p>&#163;27m</p></td><td><p>&#163;25m</p></td><td><p>&#163;16m</p></td><td><p>&#163;28m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Science Hubs</p></td><td><p>&#163;9m</p></td><td><p>&#163;9m</p></td><td><p>&#163;8m</p></td><td><p>&#163;9m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Music Hubs</p></td><td><p>&#163;76m</p></td><td><p>&#163;76m</p></td><td><p>&#163;76m</p></td><td><p>&#163;76m</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan=\"6\"><p>ITT Bursaries and Scholarships<sup> 4</sup></p></td><td><p>Maths and Numeracy</p></td><td><p>&#163;35m</p></td><td><p>&#163;50m</p></td><td><p>&#163;53m</p></td><td><p>&#163;41m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>English and literacy</p></td><td><p>&#163;33m</p></td><td><p>&#163;31m</p></td><td><p>&#163;10m</p></td><td><p>&#163;0m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Science<sup>5</sup></p></td><td><p>&#163;72m</p></td><td><p>&#163;77m</p></td><td><p>&#163;52m</p></td><td><p>&#163;33m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Music</p></td><td><p>&#163;2m</p></td><td><p>&#163;3m</p></td><td><p>&#163;1m</p></td><td><p>&#163;0m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>History</p></td><td><p>&#163;11m</p></td><td><p>&#163;14m</p></td><td><p>&#163;4m</p></td><td><p>&#163;0m</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Religious Education</p></td><td><p>&#163;3m</p></td><td><p>&#163;4m</p></td><td><p>&#163;2m</p></td><td><p>&#163;0m</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p> </p><p>1.

For example, NHS England will work with ICBs in 2024/25 to identify opportunities to support contractors to deliver additional capacity beyond their existing contractual requirements, up to 110%, and to permanently and unilaterally amend contracts which have consistently under-delivered to ensure the Units of Dental Activity (UDAs) can be released and delivered by other contract holders instead. We have started to publish monthly data on local National Health Service dental activity at the ICB level, including the proportion of UDAs being delivered in different places. We will publish new workforce data early this year to support ICBs with their commissioning function, including employment and working trends. We will also consider publishing data on community dental services, which provide care to the most vulnerable patients, and we will explore opportunities to link to other community data sets and help join-up of local services.</p>',\n",

The Government has announced a range of measures in England in response to the turbulence of the current market.</p><p>In response to the global rising costs around the price of fertiliser, Defra released new guidance to help farmers in limiting their use of slurry and other farmyard manure at certain times of the year.</p><p>Defra also announced changes to the use of urea fertiliser - delaying a planned industry farm assurance scheme which was due to start this year by at least a year. This will help farmers to manage their costs, giving them more time to adapt.</p><p>Defra has set up a Fertiliser Taskforce to address the impact of global supply pressures on farming, seeking to improve market confidence, whilst providing famers with the information they need to make business decisions on fertiliser use.</p><p>Additionally, Defra announced a permanent change to the way we make payments under the Basic Payment Scheme (BPS). We know that the price of agricultural commodities has always been closely correlated to energy prices - meaning farmers carry an increased risk on their profit and loss account, creating increased pressure on short term cash flow. We will now make BPS payments in two instalments (one from the end of July, the other December). This will give farm businesses an advanced injection of cash - with the hope of enabling farmers to make business decisions with more confidence in these uncertain times. To provide further support we have also increased Countryside Stewardship rates by an average of 30%.</p><p>Farmers are now able to apply for funding under the Sustainable Farming Incentive.
