      "my hon. friend makes an important point. we want to go with the grain of human nature, which means that, when it is time to replace a gas boiler, the heat pump is a competitive option in terms of price. that is why we think the cost of heat pumps can reduce by 25% to 50% by 2025. we have our £450 million boiler upgrade scheme to provide capital grants of up to £6,000, and that is in addition to the zero per cent rate of vat on installation. This speech was held in 2022 by Greh Hands. Party: None\n",
      "i welcome this debate and congratulate the hon. member for brighton, pavilion (caroline lucas) not only on securing it but on all the work she has done over many years to bring environmental issues to the fore in this house. i also thank my right hon. friend the member for newcastle upon tyne east (mr brown) for drawing attention to the fact that, on may day 2019, this house became the first parliament in the world to declare a climate emergency, which i am pleased to say many local authorities across britain, as well as other countries around the world, have also taken up. we have to start at a local level because, in a sense, all politics is local. if we are to win the climate debate, it is not necessarily about convincing each other in this chamber; it is about convincing a very large number of people that their living standards and livelihoods are not under threat by greening our environment, but that a green industrial revolution is a chance and an opportunity to create a high-skilled, high-paid workforce and to create the green energy jobs of the future. that will not be done if we rely on market forces; it will only be done through substantial public investment to achieve that transition to a green economy. i was at an excellent meeting on monday morning organised by islington council to launch its brilliant green agenda. it will mean better insulation in homes; transport initiatives; using waste heat from an underground station as part of a district heating scheme; using waste heat from a stepped down transformer owned by the national grid to heat a school and neighbouring properties; and installing a heat pump in a community centre to meet the passive house standard. i was struck that local authorities do not have enough planning powers to properly insulate places and properly demand of developers that we have solar panels and greened roof spaces and that we build buildings to last much longer than the planned obsolescence after 60 years before we knock them down again, with all the environmental costs of doing so. it is also about waste disposal. in my borough we manage a 30% recycling rate, which is better than it was but is nowhere near good enough. the rate should be much higher. reduce, reuse and recycle is important, but achieving it also requires the government to support local authorities, and not planning greater levels of incineration all over the country, with the pollution that results. let us look at cop26 as a great opportunity for the sharing of technology and wealth across the world, for investment in biodiversity across the world and, above all, for the transfer of knowledge held by the richest countries to all on this planet. if we do not do that, global warming and extreme weather patterns will continue and, ultimately, everyone will suffer. there will be no hiding place, however rich we might be. This speech was held in 2021 by Jeremy Corbyn. Party: None\n",
      "the hon. gentleman is right to say that we need to be moving towards technologies such as air source heat pumps. that is why our heat and buildings strategy sets out a plan to bring parity with gas boilers by 2030. that is precisely what we want to see, because those costs need to come down, and that is what we are enabling through our net zero strategy. the government are focused on protecting jobs, incomes and livelihoods through, by common assent, one of the most challenging periods in our lifetimes. nineteen months of furlough protected almost 12 million jobs across the uk. the self-employment income support scheme, worth £28 billion, benefited nearly 3 million people. we significantly increased the generosity of the local housing allowance for housing benefit, and more than 1.5 million households are benefiting from an additional £600 a year. for those who need extra help with their housing costs, we provided £140 million for discretionary housing payments. four million families are getting help with their council tax bills. we have provided nearly £5 billion for schools catch-up and we are rewarding our valued nhs and care workers, with more than 1 million nhs workers receiving a 3% pay rise in a year of otherwise wider pay restraint. it has been a goal of successive conservative governments since 2010 to keep down the cost of living for working families. i mentioned the increase in the national living wage from april, which represents an increase of more than £1,000 in the annual earnings of a full-time worker on the national living wage. that sort of thing matters in places such as stoke. we are committed to going further so that the national living wage reaches two thirds of median earnings for those over 21 by 2024, providing economic conditions allow. This speech was held in 2022 by Simon Clarke. Party: None\n",
      "i recently attended a wonderful service at st mary’s church in tickhill; it is a beautiful 12th century church and the pride of tickhill. however, it is struggling to raise finance to replace its dated heating system. if that was to be replaced with a ground-source heat pump, that would cost in excess of £750,000. what can my hon. friend suggest to help the church? many of my other churches will face the same issue, including those in hatfield, rossington, bawtry and thorne, among others. This speech was held in 2022 by Nicholas Fletcher. Party: None\n",
      "this is a large and technical bill that sets in place important frameworks, particularly when it comes to carbon capture and storage and the wider deployment of hydrogen and heat networks. i will address my comments, in the time that i have today, to part 3 of the bill, particularly the support for low-carbon heating schemes and the opportunity that this provides for doing something creative for the off-gas grid homes in this country. it links to the earlier intervention of the hon. member for strangford (jim shannon) and to a private member’s bill that i introduced at the beginning of this year. at the moment, we have 1.7 million homes in this country that are currently off the gas grid, most of which use kerosene at the moment. under the current government plan, which is born out of a strategy that dates all the way back to 2017—several governments ago—the intention is that all those 1.7 million homes would be banned from having a replacement boiler after 2026 and told that, instead, they must have, effectively, either an air source heat pump or a ground source heat pump. as the right hon. member for leeds central (hilary benn) said, there is a role for those heat pumps, but they are not for every home. in particular, in rural and especially coastal areas, air source heat pumps can be prone to rusting and decay. it is also the case that they need a lot of insulation to make them work, and, in some older homes, high levels of insulation mean less ventilation, which can lead to problems with damp, mould and all of the health problems that go with that. perhaps, more important than anything, the capital cost of these air source or ground source heat pumps for a single property is around four times that of a conventional boiler.
