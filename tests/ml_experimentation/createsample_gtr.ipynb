Second, the change in gene activity in response to immune challenge will be measured both system-wide and at single-cell resolution using high throughput sequencing techniques. Findings from these two experimental strategies will be integrated to construct gene regulatory networks (GRNs) that regulate innate immune response.

Consisting of immune cells known as T-cells, they are derived from patients, then genetically reprogrammed with a cancer-targeting T-cell receptor (TCR), before being multiplied, and reintroduced into patients to destroy cancer cells.\\n\\nUnfortunately finding these curative TCRs is a needle in a haystack problem and a major challenge using existing technologies in the lab such as mammalian display, which has an average discovery time of ~6 years and costs \\\\\\\\\\\\&gt;&pound;10million/biopsy.

This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', \"With Covid-19 causing significant limitations on asset integrity inspections due to travel restrictions, social distancing and redundancies of key, trained inspection staff, it has left many critical facilities, such as power generation (including nuclear and renewables) infrastructure at increased risk of failure and unscheduled outage. Covid has also caused a significant 22% drop in electricity demand from reduced commercial and industrial operations, forcing many stochastic renewables sources such as wind to be stopped, as well as new builds being cancelled or delayed, causing a 6% increase in efficient closed-cycle-gas-turbine (CCGT) plants to offer flexibility and grid resilience due to the changeable supply and demand requirements. This increases reliance on ageing power generation assets which require more frequent inspection to prevent forced outages.\\n\\nStatutory asset integrity inspection and fitness for service is required to justify safe and efficient operation between shutdowns and service intervals under the Pressure Systems Safety Regulations (PSSR) 2000, Office for Nuclear Regulation (ONR) and to meet climate legislation such as the Large Combustion Plant Directive.\\n\\nCracks, flaws and defects in metals and welds contribute to 77% of unscheduled outages, which have significant impacts on availability to the grid as well as huge costs running in to &pound;M's per day of lost productivity and direct costs which are passed on to the consumer. The loss in thermal efficiency due to leaks and steam loss contributes to an equivalent increase of 1-2 kTonnes of carbon dioxide per hour in UK emissions.\\n\\nInspection is typically managed on these types of infrastructure using non-destructive methods such as ultrasonic testing (UT) which offers high accuracy, penetrating power and sensitivity with non-hazardous, economical hardware to directly detect, size and characterise flaws and defects within critical components such as pipes, reactor vessels and heat exchangers.\\n\\nThe implementation of NDT inspections &amp; subsequent maintenance is routinely undertaken around planned shutdowns when assets are cool and/or isolated. This often involves an order of magnitude increase in personnel presence on site to cover as much infrastructure as possible to limit the costly outage duration.\\n\\nIonix will develop a pre-production prototype of a new ultrasonic sensor in this project, capable of the continuous monitoring of defects and flaws in alloy steel components, up to 600 C, removing the need for shutdowns to take measurements and allowing continued plant operation. These new high-temperature defect sensors will be connected to commercial WirelessHART ultrasonic nodes to be immediately accessible to power generation asset integrity end-users remotely.\\n\\nThe project will result in a prototype to demonstrate the key deliverables, engage with service providers and end-user operators to prove the technology and enable Ionix to proceed to manufacture and productionisation. If successful, an eventual product will result in greater asset intelligence on the 32 CCGT (42% of UK electricity generation) and 14 Nuclear power plants in the UK, to defer maintenance and justify cleaner more efficient operation of existing plant.\", \"Laser peening (LP) is a relatively new surface treatment technique with tremendous potential for the mitigation of otherwise life-limiting surface cracking. Using a laser to create a plasma shock wave it is possible to introduce compressive stresses deep into metallic components. These compressive stresses can have a significant effect in increasing the fatigue life of components.Paradoxically, because of the pace of commercial interest in exploiting these techniques, a basic fundamental understanding of the processes and their effects is lacking. As a result optimisation is ad-hoc and time consuming, peening can lead to unexpected stress distributions especially for complex and thin geometries, and current lifing strategies are based solely upon large test matrices. Because the stresses introduced by the laser shock wave can be very deep, the balancing tension may be sub-surface or may arise laterally. Surprisingly the 3D distributions are unknown for thin samples and around holes and webs where greatest advantages in life prolongation are likely to be obtained. Areas of particular concern relate to:- The need to optimise peening processing conditions to ensure optimal residual stress , - The lack of understanding of geometry effects which are much more complex for deep processes than for shot peening, both in terms of compressive stress and location of tensile hot spots- The stability of the residual stresses under fatigue at room and elevated temp- The lack of a process optimisation modelling tool, - The need for a validated lifing approach. In addition, in the UK nearly all the development work has been focused on Ti-6Al-4V. The lack of a database for other materials is hindering the take up of the process by other engineering sectors. LP is most cost-effective at 'hot spot' locations. Typical locations include fastener holes, webs, the leading edges of blades, blade root fixings, etc. For this reason, within this project we will focus on thin sections vs thick as well as around holes.We will first investigate the relationship between the laser peening parameters, materials properties and sample geometry (Manchester/MIC). This data will be used to develop predictive models of the process (Oxford) so that the process can be optimised and the most advantageous stress fields introduced economically for Ti, Al and steel. Then using generic test-piece geometries typical of thin sections and samples with stress concentrators, we will examine the evolution of these stresses as well as crack growth under fatigue at room (Al) (Airbus/Manchester) and elevated temperature (Ti6246) (Manchester/Swansea/Rolls-Royce) and thereby evaluate the structural integrity implications (Swansea).\", 'Doctoral Training Partnerships: a range of postgraduate training is funded by the Research Councils.

This Fellowship will launch an ambitious new research agenda that explores Jewish liberal activism as an international phenomenon for the first time. Equally concerned with liberalism and with modern Jewish history, it will promote cross-fertilisation between these fields.\\n\\nThis research will generate a book, &quot;Children of 1848: Liberalism and the Jews from the Revolutions to Human Rights&quot;; a comparatively framed article; and a workshop exploring the distinctive place of Jewish women in liberal internationalism. These activities complement a Visiting Fellowship program directed by the PI exploring 'Liberalism, Jews, Anti-semitism: the Dialectics of Inclusion c.1780-1950' and culminating in a major international conference. Both the conference and workshop will lead to collaborative publications. \\n\\nJews and the Jewish question lay at the heart of many issues that preoccupied liberals: from capitalism and its impact on traditional societies, through religious toleration, civil rights and secularism, to problems of national identity and racial hierarchy in an age of empire, internationalism and globalization. Repeatedly, Jewish businessmen, politicians, journalists, lawyers, society hostesses and social reformers emerged as key figures during moments of liberal ascendancy: from the 1848 revolutions, through 'liberal era' Germany and Austria, to Edwardian England, Giolitti's Italy and the New Deal. Examples include Viennese revolutionary leader Adolf Fischhof; Italian Prime Minister Luigi Luzzatti; Hugo Preuss writer of the Weimar Constitution; international feminist and social reformer, Alice Salomon; and US Supreme Court Judge Louis Brandeis. Later, Jewish economists, lawyers and philosophers like Ludwig von Mises, Hersch Lauterpacht and Isaiah Berlin, all of whom reached maturity between the wars, helped redefine liberalism in the 20th century. Some strands of this story are familiar, but the overarching importance of this dynamic - over such a long timeframe, in such a wide variety of geographical and political contexts - remains obscured. \\n\\nFocusing on Jews as liberal actors, not just objects of the liberal imagination, this project breaks new ground in several key respects.\\n\\nFirst, the emphasis on Jewish liberal activism undercuts an assumption that lies at the heart of existing scholarship on liberalism, namely that liberalism was a product of Christian Europe. It therefore promises to illuminate 'presentist' debates about the nature of liberal universalism and, by extension, the origins of human rights. How does our view of Western liberalism as a political tradition change, once we appreciate how far it was constructed from the margins?\\n\\nSecond, this project addresses the problem of Jewish integration in European and American political life from a new angle. The historiography of modern Jewish politics has engaged primarily with socialism and zionism. Even historians interested in Jewish liberal activism have approached this largely from a Jewish-rights perspective. This optic is too limited to address the political careers of leading liberal politicians, whose impact and agendas were not defined by their Judaism, although it was rarely incidental to them. Such figures may be the subject of individual biographies, but the connections and parallels between them remain unexplored, as do the broader liberal and Jewish networks that underpinned their activity. \\n\\nThird, the project brings new work on liberalism that reflects the global and imperial turns into conversation with older work on liberalism and the Jews, rooted in local and national contexts. Sitting at the interface between the historiography of Western liberalism and modern Jewish history, it promises to make a transformative impact on both fields.\", 'Awaiting Public Project Summary', \"The promise of this project lies in generating knowledge that both analyses and provides ways to address one of the greatest global challenges of our time: the care and well-being of children affected by transnational displacement and migration. It will offer insights into the care of separated migrant children in England, starting from the premise that care is not necessarily limited to that provided by an adult or the state. Our pilot studies demonstrate that a crucial way separated migrant children survive the challenges of migration and settlement is through the care they provide and receive from other migrant children. Using creative research methods designed to involve separated migrant children and adult stakeholders in reflecting on their understandings and experiences of care, this project will not only point to 'cracks in the system' (Rosen et al., 2017) but offer insights into what constitutes good practice and how to develop it.\\n\\nThis project sits against the backdrop of the displacement of over 65.6 million people globally, many of whom are children. Whilst some have moved with adult family members, the number who have been separated from primary carers at some point during their migration journeys has risen dramatically (Unicef, 2016). Often referred to as 'unaccompanied minors' in legal and policy contexts, we use the term 'separated child migrants' to highlight that many children maintain transnational relationships or reunite with parents at various points in the migration process, and are often accompanied by other kin and non-kin adults and children (Rosen, forthcoming).\\n\\nWhen separated migrant children arrive in the UK, they face conflicting treatment. They are protected as 'children' and entitled to the same rights to care as all other children. But, they are often treated as 'suspect' and excluded from welfare provision because of their status as 'migrants' (Crafter, forthcoming). Previous research has highlighted that the tension between immigration control and protection has led to significant differences in the quality of care provided for separated migrant children. New policy and guidance about separated migrant children is both responding to and changing the way these tensions are handled in the UK with, as yet, unknown consequences. In any case, they do not take children's care for each other into account.\\n\\nLittle is known about separated children's care for each other as they navigate contradictory, complex, and changeable immigration and welfare systems. Nor do we know how separated children's care for each other is understood and treated by relevant adult stakeholders, including social workers, foster carers, educators, youth workers, religious leaders, legal professionals, and policy makers. Our pilot studies indicate this neglect means that policies and practices designed to support separated child migrants can end up harming, excluding or discriminating against them. For instance, children who care for each other may be forcibly separated in foster care placements, go 'missing' trying to reunite, or have their 'child' status questioned.\\n\\nIn response, this project makes a needed and timely intervention. Placing separated children at its heart, this study asks: What are separated child migrants' experiences of care and caring for others? How do various economic, social and political factors shape the care priorities of relevant stakeholders? What are the theoretical, policy, and practice implications of varying understandings and practices of care?\\n\\nThis project has been designed by a multidisciplinary research team in collaboration with a range of local and national charities including Refugee Youth and MEENA (for migrant children and women in Birmingham), and involves the Refugee Council, Coram Children's Legal Project, and Barnardo's in an Advisory Group. This broad-based team ensures that the project will have meaningful impact on the lives of separated migrant children.\", \"Survival analysis has applications ranging across medicine, engineering and social sciences\\nwhere the main quantity of interest is time until an event. The methods in this project are applied to medical data where an 'event' will be defined as the death of a patient. There are a couple of models that are traditionally used by clinicians. The Kaplan Meier estimate can be used to determine whether a certain treatment has a significant effect on the survival time of a patient and the Cox proportional hazards model is used to identify individual factors that may contribute either positively or negatively to the prognosis of the patient. \\nThis project uses a new method proposed by Bart et al. (2005) in which a survival function is determined by considering the underlying dynamics of the disease. This novel approach uses the opposing disease inhibiting and disease progressing factors. By estimating this disease progression function, the speed of disease progression and the period of the disease can be determined which allows the estimation of `critical points'. These critical points correspond to the best times that medical intervention should be applied to increase the length of survival of the patient. The aim of the project is to estimate these time points. The method is currently being applied to a small data set on acute pancreatitis (AP) , a serious inflammatory disease affecting around 37,000 people in the UK every year, with future plans to extend to a larger AP data set and other medical data sets that become available.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research. This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', \"This project will use two niche applications to bridge the gap between academic excellence and industrial progress in the development of efficient pure electric power take off in wave energy converters. Compared to electrical machines in other industrial sectors, wave energy converters are slow which has led to a range of novel generators being developed, yet comparatively few have been demonstrated at full scale with developers instead preferring to use conventional generators connected via device specific mechanical linkages. Pure electric drive train concepts are known to be efficient and mechanically simple but must now be proved feasible and advantageous at a meaningful device scale. If the electrical generator is allowed to run flooded with sea water, there will be no requirement for sealing and therefore a much reduced requirement for maintenance. The concept must be demonstrated at sea whilst the performance is monitored. Investor confidence must be gained in the technology by accruing many hours of operational data. Long term operational issues of corrosion, biofouling, reliability and condition monitoring must be tackled. \\n\\nNewcastle and Edinburgh Universities have been at the forefront of UK academic work in electric drives and wave energy converters for decades, and this collaborative team will now deliver two niche application prototypes to demonstrate all electric drive trains for wave energy converters. The project will design and demonstrate direct drive power take off for subsea communication networks and also powering subsea equipment for the oil and gas industry. A full scale electrical machine will be demonstrated using experience provided by an industrial partner. In addition, submerged electric generators will be demonstrated at sea for 12 months using Newcastle's USMART acoustic network gateway buoy. Corrosion protection and antifouling techniques specifically for the electrical generator will be demonstrated first in the laboratory before being used in the ocean.\", 'Stem cells are present within our bodies throughout our lives and are very important because they make sure that as damaged and worn out cells die, there is a supply of new cells to replace them. Some organs and tissues have a tremendous capacity to replace cells, e.g. the blood, the liver and the gut. However, organs such as the brain and heart have very limited capacity for repair and regeneration. Stem cells have been isolated from a variety of adult sources including bone marrow, gut and muscle and also from early stage embryos. Research has shown that these stem cells have two remarkable properties. They can divide to form two identical stem cells (self-renew themselves) or they can form many other types of cells (differentiate). There is currently great interest in harnessing these unique properties because by using stem cells it may be possible to generate cells in the laboratory, that can be used to either replace damaged tissues inside the body or to identify safer and more effective medicines. Many chronic diseases cannot currently be effectively treated because loss of cells is the underlying cause, e.g. type 1 diabetes. Parkinson?s disease and stem cell-based therapies offer exciting alternative treatments for disease sufferers. However, much more research needs to be carried out to understand stem cell behaviour before such advances will be brought into modern day medical practice. \\n\\nThe overall objective of this research proposal is to understand in greater detail the processes that control the ability of stem cells to renew themselves. Several signals within stem cells are known to be important in controlling self-renewal and our recent studies have identified a new regulator of this process. We identified this new regulator by analysing genes whose expression changes at early times after embryonic stem cells start to differentiate. This gene is predicted to control the regulation of other genes and we wish to now investigate this in more detail. Using cellular, genetic and biochemical experiments we will determine how this gene works in embryonic stem cells. By understanding the processes that control self-renewal of stem cells in more detail we should be able to apply this knowledge to the exploitation of stem cells in regenerative medicine and drug discovery. Stem cell-based strategies offer real hope for the sufferers of many chronic diseases and the research proposed here could be of real benefit in the medium to longer-term.', 'To develop in vitro laboratory methods to measure the dermal absorption of organic soil contaminants associated with former industrial sites.

However poor bee motivation often leads to reduced pollination success. Building on our results showing that artificial chemicals can be used to increase Bombus terrestris foraging activity in the laboratory, we will elucidate the optimum chemical blend and test its efficacy at increasing pollination levels and crop yield of a commercially important crop (tomatoes) in greenhouse conditions. Having established our artificial foraging recruitment pheromone effectively mimics the natural bumblebee system to communicate the presence of food outside the nest, we will develop a cost-effective automatic system to dispense pheromone into bumblebee nests at timed intervals. To increase global applicability of this innovative technology to maximise crop yields, we will determine the components of the recruitment pheromone of Bombus impatiens, the species used exclusively for greenhouse pollination in the USA.', 'The devices we use on a daily basis place huge strain on the communication networks we rely on for almost every component of our digitally connected lives. Network connected appliances; from coffee machines to lightbulbs are becoming commonplace and not purely something from our favourite Sci-fi TV show. All of this connected technology is moving us towards the Internet of Things. This new Internet landscape will require fundamental structural changes in the network tools used to link homes and businesses, and potential re-designs of the network architecture. \\n\\nDuring this project I will be exploring the development of next generation technology focused on delivering multiplicative capacity boosts to the last mile portion of our communications networks.\\n\\nThese last-mile links are those that connect our homes to the larger network, and are the most challenging area of the network to upgrade due to the larger number of branched connections. An optical property known as Orbital Angular Momentum will be used as a method to multiplex data carrying signals over the communications link offering a large boost to the achievable data rates. The project will involve both fundamental studies of the behaviour of this optical property, along with the development of technology allowing this property to be implemented into potential commercially available devices.\\n\\nBeyond these devices use within communications, there will be a focus on implementing this technology into other areas such as sensing, imaging and medical devices.', 'The manufacture of biocompatible materials for tissue replacement is a central theme in the fields of biomedicine and tissue engineering research. Natural sources of bone graft material are compromised by availability and cost, both from the individual patient as autograft and from other donors as allograft. &quot;Third generation&quot; bioactive implant materials, which play an active role in tissue regeneration and degrade after the tissue has healed, have been remarkably successful in many clinical applications, especially in dental and orthopaedic fields. Among the third-generation biomedical materials, phosphate-based bio-active glasses (PBGs) are becoming increasingly popular owing to their unique properties: (i) their composition is chemically related to the surrounding tissue; (ii) they dissolve completely in aqueous media; (iii) their dissolution rate can be controlled by changing the composition of the phosphate-sodium-calcium glass. The solubility of the PBGs, which is arguably their most important property to be exploited in biomedical applications, can thus be tailored to suit the end application. As the solubility of a glass is linked to its atomic-level structure, insight into the P2O5 network structure at the molecular level; the effect of varying concentrations of calcium and sodium and other cations on the network; and the dominant surface and dissolution processes, are of fundamental interest to the design of phosphate glass compositions for applications in tissue engineering. However, a common problem in the investigation of these materials, generally related to their amorphous nature, is the lack of detailed information on the microscopic structure of the glasses and how this structure is affected by the different ions making up the glass composition. This research proposal therefore aims to develop robust models to provide quantitative insight at the atomic level into the structures, physico-chemical properties and solubilities of a range of phosphate-based bioglasses as a function of their composition.', 'The food retail industry is experiencing increasing demand from consumers for UK grown fresh produce and would like to substitute imports with home produce. The demand for home grown plums cannot currently be met due to unreliable and\\ninefficient cropping systems. This collaborative project will develop integrated new technologies that will address the major existing production problems and limitations for fresh plums. The sustainable intensification of this horticultural crop will be achieved through integration of a high-density growing system with new rootstocks, varieties and manipulation of tree architecture for increased yield, coupled with protected cropping regimes and component technologies that will regulate crop load, fruit ripening and give significant season extension. This intensive and profitable growing system will enable UK growers to confidently invest in plum production, delivering substantial economic impact (&gt;&pound;10 m/yr) to the UK horticulture industry.', 'The thesis research will focus on studies of nanoparticulate bentonite clay colloids. These studies are fundamental to understanding how the material would act as a buffer in a geological disposal facility, sitting between the canisters containing high level nuclear waste and the walls of the bore holes where they will sit. The information that is sought is to form a better understanding of the selective binding of several cations (Cs, Ni and Eu), how these are affected by the average size of the colloid particles and how the colloid assists in transporting these through granite fissures. Specific aspects will include studying different ways to produce the colloids, size them and measure their flow.', \"The Universe is full of particles with such high-energies that they are travelling at very close to the speed of light. These particles play a significant role in many areas of astrophysics, from the life-cycles of stars to the evolution of galaxies. These particles are hard to trace, but can reveal their presence by producing gamma rays. Like their lower-energy cousins, X-rays, gamma rays do not penetrate the Earth's atmosphere and usually satellite-based telescopes are used to detect them. However, at very high energies (VHE) there are very few gamma rays, and detecting them from spacecraft becomes impossible. Luckily, it is possible to detect them from the ground via the flashes of blue light, Cherenov radiation, produced by the cascades they initiate in the atmosphere. The glow from Cherenkov radiation in the atmosphere is 10,000 times fainter than starlight, so large mirrors are required to collect it, and because the flashes last only a few billionths of a second, ultra-fast cameras are needed to record them. \\n\\nWe know from current ground-based gamma-ray telescopes such as HESS that there is a wealth of phenomena to be studied. VHE gamma ray telescopes have detected the remains of supernova explosions, binary star systems, highly energetic jets produced by black holes in distant galaxies, star formation regions, and many other objects. These observations can help us to understand not only what is going on inside these objects, but also answer fundamental physics questions relating to the nature of dark matter and of space-time itself. However, we have now reached the limit of what can be done with current instruments, and so ~800 scientists from 25 countries around the world have come together to build a new instrument - the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA). CTA will offer a dramatic increase in sensitivity over current instruments, and extends the energy range of the gamma rays observed to both lower and higher energies. It is predicted that the catalogue of known VHE emitting objects will expand from the 130 known to over 1000, and we can expect many new discoveries in key areas of astrophysics and fundamental physics research. \\n\\nTo achieve the wide energy range we require of CTA, it is necessary to build telescopes of three different sizes: ~5 m diameter small-sized telescopes (SSTs), ~12 m medium-sized telescopes (MSTs) and ~23 m large-sized telescope (LST). CTA will consist of two arrays of telescopes, one in the northern hemisphere and one in the southern hemisphere. The northern array will likely consist of 4 or so LSTs, and around 20 MSTs. The southern array will contain similar numbers of large and medium telescopes, but add to them an extensive array of ~50 SSTs, specifically to investigate the highest-energy phenomena which can be observed preferentially from the southern hemisphere. The SSTs will detect the highest energy photons ever seen, with energies approach a petaelectronvolt, each a thousand billion times more energetic than an X-ray. CTA is currently in its preparatory phase, and we expect construction to start in 2015.\\n\\nThere are currently 11 UK universities involved in CTA. The UK groups are concentrating their efforts on the construction of the SSTs. We have already produced an innovative dual-mirror SST design, which will be built in sight of the Eiffel Tower in Paris. In this proposal we request funds to do several things. Firstly, we want to build and test a prototype dual-mirror SST camera, together with a calibration system. Secondly, we will use our expertise in computer simulations to optimise the design of the SSTs and the overall array layout. Thirdly, we will develop data analysis techniques for CTA, to ensure that UK scientists are able to analyse the data from CTA as soon as the first telescopes start operation. Finally, several UK team members have leadership roles in CTA and we are requesting funds to support these people and enable us to travel to the relevant meetings.\", 'The public description for this project has been requested but has not yet been received.', 'There is an epidemic of primarily tubular-interstitial chronic kidney disease (CKD) clustering in agricultural communities in low-and-middle income countries (LMICs). Although it is currently unclear whether there is a common underlying cause, these conditions have been collectively termed CKD of unknown cause (CKDu). CKDu is estimated to have led to the premature deaths of tens to hundreds of thousands of young adults in LMICs over the last two decades. Thus, there is an urgent need to understand the aetiology and pathophysiology of these condition(s) and to develop preventive interventions.\\nWe have now established that CKDu exists in Central America (Nicaragua) and South Asia (India, Sri Lanka), but not in some other tropical countries (Malawi, Peru). It is not clear yet whether the epidemics in Central America and South Asia have common causes or different causes, which is why is it important to conduct research using the same protocols and methods in these different regions.\\n \\nTogether with colleagues we have established prospective studies in affected communities in Nicaragua, South India, Sri Lanka to investigate the causes of the epidemics of CKDu, and factors which affect prognosis. We already have published striking findings from Nicaragua, where 10% of the community, who were apparently healthy when we started following them, have lost one-third of their kidney function in two years of follow-up - so something very alarming and striking is occurring.\\n \\nThe underlying hypothesis is that CKDu is caused by unknown factors to which the populations have become exposed due to the changes in agricultural practice, or other environmental changes (e.g. water supply), over recent decades. \\n \\nThe objectives of the proposed Programme Grant research are to investigate the environmental causes of renal decline in these high-risk populations, using both standardised instruments capturing occupational and environmental exposures. We will address four proposed causes of CKDu: (i) metals and metaloids; (ii) agrochemicals; (iii) infections by organisms that affect the kidney; and (iv) heat/dehydration. To achieve these objectives we aim to: (i) extend the follow-up to at least four years in each of the three studies (Nicaragua, India, Sri Lanka); (ii) expand each prospective study to a total of 1000 participants to increase the power of the primary analyses; (iii) use standardized questionnaires to capture self-reported exposures; (iv) directly measure exposures to metals, agrochemicals, infections and heat/dehydration; (v) identify potential biomarkers of early disease; and (vi) identify genetic factors which affect decline in kidney function.', 'Doctoral Training Partnerships: a range of postgraduate training is funded by the Research Councils.

Saying &quot;there exists a y such that x = y2 is equivalent to &quot;x = 0&quot;, and saying &quot;for all x, there do not exist y such that danger(x,y)&quot; is a proof of correctness, in this respect, of a safety-critical system. Many safety-critical systems are currently proved safe by similar techniques over Booleans, but not reasoning over the reals as such. However , there are very hard instances of QE (DavenportHeintz1988 etc.), which has led to research into worst-case algorithms by the PI and many others. However, little research has been done on &quot;good on average problems&quot; algorithms and heuristics, which are what the industrial community actually need. We can draw a strong parallel with SAT-solving for Boolean expressions, which is in daily use in industry, even though this is NP-complete (only known algorithms are exponential) in the worst case. \\n\\nThe initial area of research will be in Virtual Term Substitution (VTS) to pre-condition purely existential QE problems before solution, for example, by Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition (CAD). This will require, amongst other things, significant programming in Maple using the package RegularChains. From there theory and experimentation into how much benefit is being gained from using such techniques can be looked into, in particular analysis on running times of the algorithms on a repository of real world example problems. In parallel, other recent developments such as NuCAD (Brown2017) should be investigated. As such early hypotheses and minor results should be expected before a visit to the CASE sponsor (Maplesoft) in 2018, equipped with early versions of useful code from such areas of research, written to appropriate specification via the standards of the symbolic computation community.', 'Antagonism of the dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) is required for the efficacy of all clinically used antipsychotic drugs (APDs) for the treatment of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, antagonism of the D2R is associated with extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) such as Parkinsonism, and tardive dyskinesia. Some newer APDs (termed atypical APDs) are thought to have a lower side-effect risk but the mechanism behind these differences is unclear. We have recently shown that the binding association rate of APDs predicts their ability to cause EPS although we lack direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon. Furthermore, in another recent study we have revealed that some but not all APDs can act as pharmacological chaperones to increase cell surface expression of D2Rs. Increases in brain D2R after chronic treatment with APDs have been suggested as the reason for iatrogenic psychoses and for resistance of schizophrenia patients to pharmacotherapy over time. APD-induced upregulation of D2R has also been implicated in tardive dyskinesia, suggesting that chronic D2R upregulation can produce permanent adverse alterations in D2R-expressing neurons. However, neither the inverse agonist properties or the chaperone activity have been studied in brain cells relevant to EPS. Hypothesis: Understanding the molecular basis of drug rebinding and pharmacological chaperoning activity of APDs at the D2R will reveal differences in antipsychotic drug action that predict their side effect profile. This project will use a wide range of imaging and biophysical techniques in combination with classical pharmacology and biochemistry approaches to address this hypothesis. We have used Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) to show that drug interactions with the cell membrane and receptors drives a higher local concentration of drug proximal to the cell membrane and developed a series of fluorescently-labeled D2R antagonists whose binding kinetics properties span the range of those exhibited by APDs. The student will investigate the molecular determinants of drug rebinding. Using FCS in model cell lines expressing different levels of SNAP-D2R in combination with fluorescent D2R ligands with known binding kinetics, we will assess how different levels of cell surface D2R expression can drive local concentrations of the drug. Then the student will extend these studies to primary cultures of striatal and cortical neurons as well as pituitary lactotrophs derived from the SNAP-D2R mouse to understand how these phenomena might impact drug rebinding at endogenously expressed D2Rs in disease-relevant tissues. In parallel, the student will use Tr-FRET binding to measure the binding kinetics of selected unlabelled APDs at natively expressed D2Rs in the above primary neuronal cultures. To investigate the ability of different APDs to drive D2R cell surface expression the student will use BRET to quantify D2R trafficking. These experiments will be complemented with classical confocal, TIRF microscopy and high content imaging. Then we will extend these studies to primary cell cultures expressing the SNAP-D2R to investigate the impact of the acute and longer-term application of APDs on D2R expression and trafficking in these disease-relevant cells.', \"Summary: Dimpled steel sections are cold roll formed by the Hadley group. These dimpled sections have been analysed and it is reported that they can carry more load comparing to the pre-dimpled plain steel sections.

Analysis of contact pressure and friction force in the cold roll forming process will also be conducted to eliminate galling.\\nPartners' roles: The project requires bending and tensile test of structures.

Now it can be hypothesised that the techniques that have been used to predict aerodynamic effects in the past (wind tunnel and CFD methods) are likely to determine magnitudes of pressures, velocities, forces etc. that are higher than those observed in practice, where other effects - such as track roughness, variability in meteorological conditions etc. are likely to usually obscure aerodynamic effects to some extent and, because of this, some of the current design methodologies are unnecessarily restrictive and/or conservative. Thus the aim of the current project is to investigate and measure a range of aerodynamic phenomena observed in real train operation, both relative to the train and relative to a fixed point at the trackside, and to compare how such effects match model scale measurements and various types of CFD calculation, and thus to test the validity, or otherwise, of the above hypothesis. This will be achieved through the instrumentation of the Network Rail High Speed Measuring Train to measure aerodynamic effects, as the train carries out its normal duty cycle around the UK rail network. Also trackside instrumentation will be installed at a suitable site that will allow off-train phenomena to be measured. Calibration wind tunnel, CFD and moving model tests will be carried out in the conventional way for comparison with data measured at full scale. The full scale, model scale and computational trials will be carried out by experienced RFs and will provide data for two doctoral studies, one of which will investigate how the train based measurements of cross wind forces, pressure transients etc compare with those predicted by conventional methodologies, and one of which will investigate how the track side measurements compare with conventional test results. The investigators will synthesise the results and make recommendations for future aerodynamic test methods.', 'Nottingham has major challenges in common with other cities in delivering public services more efficently and being more responsive to our citizens and businesses.

Development of a new &quot;Smart City Information Model&quot; will help organisations and individuals to access and use information to support more sustainable city planning. The first step of this is to undertake a feasibility study to work with partners in all sectors to develop proposals for how these systems can start to work together.', \"Efficient communication between brain cells or neurons is a fundamental process required for brain function. This is achieved through specialised contacts between neurons called synapses. The level of communication between synapses varies according to the stimuli received by the neuron. Modulation of this synaptic communication is called synaptic plasticity, a process that underlies crucial functions such as learning and memory. One mode of synaptic plasticity, called long-term potentiation (LTP), increases the strength of synaptic communication. A critical molecule in this process is the neurotransmitter glutamate which binds to receptors, molecules that act as surface antennas at synapses to convey information to the inside of the cell. Binding of glutamate to specific receptors located at the synapse, called NMDA receptors, has profound effects on the connectivity of neurons and on synaptic potentiation. This process is involved in fundamental brain functions such as learning and memory. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the connectivity between neurons at synapses is profoundly affected in early stages of the disease. Several studies suggest that the weakening of synapses contributes to the loss of these tiny structures, resulting in memory impairment and difficulties in performing basic tasks in patients. Despite the extensive progress made in recent years in scientific research studying the mechanisms that control synaptic connectivity, our understanding of how synapses are modulated in the healthy brain and in conditions such as AD remains very limited. \\n\\nOur research group has been studying the function of a group of proteins called Wnts. These molecules are released by cells and promote the formation of connections between neurons. We recently found that Wnt proteins are present at the synapse and modulate the formation and size of synapses in the hippocampus, a brain area that plays a central role in learning and memory. Our latest work has also demonstrated that Wnts are important modulators of synaptic plasticity that depends on NMDA receptors. Furthermore, our studies have led to the identification of a Wnt receptor that mediates this form of synaptic plasticity. However, the precise molecular mechanisms by which Wnts influence synaptic plasticity through these receptors are not well understood. In the current project, we will address this central question to advance scientific knowledge in this area. \\n\\nOur recent studies demonstrate that the receptor for Wnts at the synapse is decreased in the brain of mouse models of AD, which have been developed to mimic the disease. This finding is in agreement with the hypothesis that deficiency in Wnt molecules contributes to synaptic defects, resulting in memory impairment in AD. In this project, we will also investigate the contribution of this Wnt receptor to synaptic defects in AD mouse models and to test whether modulation of this receptor restores memory. Our studies could have important implications for developing strategies to restore memory in Alzheimer's disease.\", 'Volcanic eruptions have significant impacts on any surrounding forests. During major eruptions trees may be scorched or flattened by lateral blasts &amp; pyroclastic flows, buried by volcanic mudflows or damaged by ashfall. Even during low level activity sustained gas emissions alter the density and character of vegetation. Volcanic damage to forests can be detected in reflectance and scattering properties extracted from satellite imagery. The rates and processes of recovery following volcanic eruptions have not yet been well-quantified, but have potential as a tool for identifying and assessing the date of past eruptions, independent from geological methods. This project will exploit multi-platform satellite datasets to map extensive and spatially variable changes in forests after volcanic eruptions, with a particular focus on the period of recovery. \\n\\n \\n\\nThis studentship will address the following questions:\\n\\n- How do major volcanic eruptions affect selected tropical and temperate forest ecosystems? This will be addressed through case studies of major eruptions, for example, the impact of the 2011 eruption of Chaiten, Chile. Significant volcanic impacts to investigate could include the flattening or burial of trees, leaf damage from ashfall, the effect of volcanic gases on vegetation and alteration of drainage/water supply due to topographic change.\\n\\n- Can the footprint of past eruptions be detected in forests surrounding active volcanoes?\\n\\n- What factors affect the rate or recovery of temperate and tropical forests after an eruption?\\n\\n \\n\\nTime series of vegetation change will be mapped in the first instance using indexes derived from optical imagery (e.g., LANDSAT, Sentinel-2), with more quantitative analysis over critical periods using Synthetic Aperture Radar imagery (e.g., Sentinel-1 and higher resolution commercial datasets TSX and CSK where available). \\n\\nThis work will build a new understanding of the characteristics of volcanic impacts on vegetation, and of recovery rates related to different types of volcanic activity. We will test if the spatial extent, nature and intensity of impacts can be interpreted to provide information about past eruption. To do this we will draw on recent events for which pre- and post-eruption satellite imagery are available, as well as looking for longer-term imprints of major eruptions on forest structure.', 'tbc', 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research.

Most patients do not seek medical attention until they develop swallowing difficulties and by then the cancer is usually advanced with a 5-year survival of 20%. However, if the cancer is detected early then the survival rate can be improved to 80%. These cancers usually develop as a complication of a condition called Barrett?s oesophagus. However, most people in the population with Barrett?s oesophagus will not develop cancer. Therefore research is needed to identify the patients at greatest risk for oesophageal cancer. In this grant we are testing some promising molecular tools to see whether they can predict cancer progression using a large clinical biopsy resource from the Northern Ireland Barrett s Oeospagus Register. If we could find a molecular test that predicted cancer development this would prevent many patients with Barrett s oeosphagus having unecessary endoscopy examinations and enable us to target resources to patients at highest risk.', \"The cells of every organism contain a chemical code within their DNA molecules that holds the information needed for making all the protein products required to make the cell grow and stay alive. The code is in the form of a linear sequence of nucleotide bases, the famous A,G, C &amp; T. The order of these letters determines the subsequent linear order of amino acids of the cell's proteins, which ultimately determine its structure and function. Converting the nucleotide information into the encoded amino acid sequence is known as as gene expression. The first step in this process is one of the most important reactions inside cells and involves making an RNA copy - a transcript- of the DNA message. The enzymes involved in this process - RNA polymerases - must start the copying process at a defined point in DNA, known as the promoter. In cells, this process is tightly regulated and determines the pattern of genes being read and thus contributes to the precise execution of the cellular genetic program. We are studying the basic mechanisms that control the choice of start site and the controlled activation of the RNA polymerase from a passive DNA-binding protein into the active copying machine. In particular we are studying how the protein components of transcription machinery use the energy currency of the cell-a molecule called ATP-to function as small machines and to interconvert between different states. We would like to know the detailed features and the conformational changes in the transcription machinery during the initial steps - when the double stranded DNA is opened up in single strand forms and the template strand is delivered into the site of RNAP for synthesizing RNA.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research.

One of the most consistent immune findings across psychotic-mood spectrum disorders is a reduction in the proportion of circulating regulatory T-cells which may be reversed with medication. We have argued that the effects of Treg depletion on brain myelination processes may confer postpartum psychosis risk in women. \\n\\nWe aim to systematically investigate, for the first time, the consequences of acute Treg depletion, with a view to understanding how reduced Treg levels might influence relevant affective (fear/anxiety), cognitive (sensory processing and attention) and immune phenotypes; we will then attempt to rescue any abnormalities identified with immunomodulatory or antipsychotic drugs. \\n\\nWe will use two mouse models in which Treg complement can either be partially (anti-CD25 antibody administration) or fully (diphtheria-toxin (DT) administration to transgenic mice expressing DT receptor on Tregs) depleted, to recapitulate the clinical situation, or to elicit maximal phenotypic effects, respectively. The acute experimental manipulations have no effect on gross health/wellbeing. In a recent pilot study, we have shown that acute, complete Treg depletion in adult female mice is associated with significantly altered brain expression of several genes implicated in psychosis e.g. Gbp4, Lcn2, Sgk1 and Ifitm3. With co-applicants from Bristol with expertise in genetic epidemiology, we will test whether genes/pathways sensitive to Treg depletion are enriched for genetic risk variants associated with psychotic mood disorder, linking our animal work to human genetic risk variants. \\n\\nThe mouse experimental manipulations will be performed in male and female wildtype animals, at key developmental timepoints, and, in females, in the postpartum period.

At the same time the infrastructure underpinning social inquiry has also been revolutionised through improvements in telecommunications and computing capacity. The same forces that are leading to social transformation are at the same time providing tools for its analysis. This is certainly true in terms of survey research where the amount of high quality cross-national research has increased in the last thirty years. Mergers and acquisitions in the social research market have resulted in a smaller number of influential players with global reach. \\nIn the foreground of these longer-term developments, the UK's vote to leave the European Union has given new stimulus to the question of Britain's 'place in the world', and how its should be positioning itself after Brexit. Will it remain closely tethered to the continent of Europe, continuing to see it as a point of reference for social and public policy? Or will it turn its face away, westwards towards the Americas, or eastwards to face the emerging nations and the newly emboldened Asian capitalism? In the context of both this background and this foreground, the project aims to explore the feasibility of creating a global social survey (GLOSOC) that could inform the study of global change, and the role of the UK within that process. Should there indeed be a case for such a piece of infrastructure, what form is it to take and how (and by whom) is it to be created?\\n\\nThe proposed work proceeds as follows: by way of preliminaries it will undertake a rapid review of the international survey landscape, in order to assess what has been achieved, and whether there remain significant data deserts in either substantive or geographical terms. These will include the International Social Survey Programme, the World Values Survey, the Generations and Gender Programme, the Gallup World Poll and Pew's Global Attitudes Survey. It will be complemented by a parallel evaluation of the UK's participation in, and exploitation of results from, such international surveys. On the basis of the landscape mapping, potential stakeholders will be contacted to discuss the project and some recruited as expert members of advisory panels. The consultation process will include interviews, expert groups and the development of a communications plan.\\n\\nThe next stage of work will establish the strategic aims for a GLOSOC and with them the basis parameters within which it will be developed: its scale, its geographical coverage, its size and range of content, its frequency, and the central questions for any new survey - measuring what, for whom, and to what end? Once the strategic purpose is defined, the next phase of work will have three strands: firstly the strategic vision for the survey will be refined by a Technical Advisory Panel, in order to put firmer numbers to the guiding parameters, and even at this preliminary stage, identify items for testing in potential candidate countries. Another key concern for the panel will be the question of 'interoperability', essentially ensuring that the new piece of survey infrastructure will be harmonised to a degree with pre-existing cross-national resources, in terms of its subject matter, its geographical composition, and its methodological principles. At the same time it will explore the legal and operational issues presented by the need to manage and keep secure future respondent data; there will also be a blueprint for governance and operations structures that ensure fair representation and use and develop scientific capability.\\n\\nThe final phase of the work will produce an 'options analysis', in which a spectrum of models for a GLOSOC will be presented and evaluated. After receiving feedback on an interim version, the project will produce its final position paper, with recommendations for action.\", \"Traditional chemical risk assessment relies on undertaking laboratory ecotoxicity studies, but can only assume what the population or ecosystem functioning consequences might be. We aim to move beyond these current limitations by interrogating wildlife population data (terrestrial, freshwater and marine) in the context of chemical exposure in a way that will progress the field. \\n\\nOur high-level aim is to identify which populations and environments are doing well under the current chemical regime and which are not. This will allow the UK to focus its research where the greatest wildlife declines are occurring and bring clarity to the issue of chemical risk in the environment that continues to cause great uncertainty.\\n\\nOnly a few studies have exploited Britain's long-term wildlife population data with regards to the influence of chemical exposure. Chemical exposures we will examine will include pesticides in the terrestrial and freshwater environments, the chemical mixture in sewage effluent, metals and persistent organic pollutants. We will be looking at macroinvertebrates and fishes in our rivers, invertebrates and sparrowhawks on land and cetaceans (dolphins and killer whales) off our coasts. These environments and species represent current concerns across the natural environment for both diffuse and point source pollution. We will focus on species and taxa that are either core providers of ES or represent aspects of native biodiversity identified by the public as important to societal wellbeing. There are many stressors and compensating factors other than chemicals that can influence wildlife populations. We will incorporate such factors into our analyses to assess their role and significance and thus also address the research question: How important are chemical stressors in relation to other pressures in the environment? By comparing long-term and spatially explicit trends in natural populations, with the response predicted by classical ecotoxicity as reported in the literature, we will evaluate whether such tests are indicative of impacts in the wild. This is essential to assess to what extent traditional risk assessments, typical of those used in the Water Framework and similar Directives, are predictive of outcomes for wildlife populations in terrestrial, freshwater or marine environments.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research. This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', 'Background \\nSpecial white blood cells, called regulatory T cells (Tregs) normally keep the immune system in check: too much control lets cancer arise, while too little regulation leads to autoimmunity. Special molecules on the surface of cells, called co-receptors, can mediate and alter Treg function. Co-receptors that share the same ligand can trigger either an increase or decrease in the immune response. These co-receptors appear to be good drug targets to stop cancer and/or autoimmunity with some already in use clinically (CTLA-4, PD1), and others being developed. \\nOne such co-receptor that does regulate the immune system is CD96, and we want to find out how it works. CD96 shares its ligand CD155 with the co-receptors CD226, which turns the immune response up, and TIGIT, which lowers the immune response. Tregs do express all three co-receptors, but we do not yet know how they dictate Treg function and how exactly CD96 regulates the whole pathway.\\n\\nHypothesis and Aims\\nWe believe CD96 regulates the immune responses by controlling the ligand CD155 for the other co-receptors in the same family and we think this affects how Tregs work.\\nWe will test this overall hypothesis with three main questions in our aims:\\n\\nAim 1: How does CD96 actively take CD155 into the cell?\\nAim 2: What other molecules inside the cell work with CD96 for its action?\\nAim 3: How does CD96 change Treg functions?\\n\\nExperimental Plan\\nWe will use continuously growing cell line models as well as cells from the blood of healthy people that we can modify to only express specific co-receptors. \\nWe have some data that suggests that CD96 works by taking CD155 from other cells. We will generate cell lines that express CD96 and CD155 with fluorescent tags that glow when specific light is shone on them. That way we can see and follow how CD96 and CD155 interact and move around inside the cells by using a powerful confocal microscope, flow cytometry to evaluate many parameters on each cell at once and biochemical assays where we can pull out CD96 and proteins bound to it and then measure them. By changing parts of CD96 before functional tests, we can find out which part of CD96 is important for its functions. We will also look at how CD96 competes for CD155 binding and/or interacts with the other co-receptor family members CD226/TIGIT.\\nWe will look for the proteins that bind to CD96 inside the cell after it has bound ligand to enable CD96 actions. We have some candidates that likely bind to CD96 inside the cell, but we will also screen for new proteins interacting with CD96 inside the cell after it has seen its ligand CD155. \\nWe will use cutting edge techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 to take away CD96 (CD96 knockout) from healthy human Tregs to find out for what cell functions CD96 is necessary. We will test how this knockout changes the activation, proliferation and signalling of Tregs. Tregs can supress other T cells from dividing, thus we will test also whether CD96 influences this crucial Treg function. Since effector T cells can also express CD96, we will test them in parallel to look for CD96 actions that are Treg-specific and ones that are universal for cells expressing CD96. \\n\\nImportance \\nThe immune system is tightly regulated in health, but too much control leads to cancer and too little to autoimmunity. By understanding how the co-receptor CD96 regulates the immune system and how it affects Treg functions, we will be able to harness that knowledge in the future to design new drugs targeting the co-receptor to treat cancer and/or autoimmunity.', 'Doctoral Training Partnerships: a range of postgraduate training is funded by the Research Councils.

Drug combinations slow the virus but it has developed resistance to all the current ones and new ones are needed which stop virus replication. When HIV assembles it packages its genes, which are on a long piece of RNA similar to our own DNA. There are lots of other RNAs in the cell and HIV recognises its own because this RNA folds up into a complex but distinct ?knot? like shape. The virus captures this RNA at a particular place inside the cell. Drugs blocking this process would provide a potentially very powerful new weapon against HIV. The plan is to deduce the structures of all the molecules involved and also where the capture happens so we can design antiviral molecules and get them to the correct place to work against the virus.

There are three main forms in which the disease manifests; visceral (VL, also known as kala-azar and the most serious form of the disease), cutaneous (CL, the most common) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). Epidemics are a severe public health problem in some of the poorest communities in Africa, Asia and Latin America, where malnutrition, weak immune systems, poor housing and sanitation, and lack of financial resources increase the risk of the disease. The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimate that there are annually between 700 000 and 1 million new cases of the disease, and 26 000 to 65 000 leishmaniasis related deaths. Treatments for the disease do exist, however many of the commonly used drugs exhibit severe side effects, and an increasingly pressing issue with current chemotherapeutics is emerging resistance in Leishmania. Moreover, most antileishmanial drugs (antimonials, miltefosine, paromomycin, and pentamidine) have no target proteins identified. Leishmania adapt to different habitats in their life cycle and exist in two different forms: the promastigote in the phlebotomine sandfly vector, and the amastigote in the mammalian host. We predict that epigenetic processes mediate the phenotypic changes that occur when the parasite adapts to its environment. Bromodomains exist as part of bromodomain-containing proteins (BCPs) and play a key role in regulating transcription in humans. Bromodomains mediate protein-protein interactions by binding to acetylated lysine residues (KAc) found in histone proteins, which condense and structure DNA stored in chromatin. Acetyl lysine mimic based small molecule ligands binding to human bromodomains have been identified and the proteins have been postulated as potential targets for several diseases including cancer, inflammation, and diabetes. Given the fundamental role played by bromodomains in regulating transcription in humans, we hypothesise that BCPs play an equally important role in other organisms. We will investigate whether these proteins are novel therapeutic targets to impede the life cycle of Leishmania dononavi and provide new avenues for the treatment of Leishmaniasis. In this project we will collaborate with Dr Nathaniel Jones, Prof. Jeremy Mottram, Prof. Anthony Wilkinson and Catherine Russell (University of York) who have cloned the Leishmania bromodomain coding sequences for LdBD2, LdBD3 and LdBD5.1 and LdBD5.2 in Leishmania donovani. Co-crystal structures of known human bromodomain ligands, Bromosporine, SCG-CBP30 and BI-2536, demonstrate complexing with some of these BCPs, although Kd values for the ligands have not yet been evaluated. To provide the basis for an antiparasitic drug, we require a ligand with high affinity for the parasite protein and low affinity for the human protein. We will adopt a fragment-based screening approach with acetylated lysine mimics and evaluate the small molecule binding to Leishmania bromodomains in biophysical assays. Once we establish the criteria for protein binding, we will apply this knowledge to design novel ligands for Leishmania bromodomains. The aim of the project is to design, synthesize and optimize small molecules to probe the function of BCPs in Leishmania. In collaboration with GSK, our ligands will be used in phenotypic screening to provide information for future drug discovery efforts for targeting bromodomains in Leishmania. This project will also contribute to our wider understanding of parasite epigenetics and help us to determine whether epigenetic functions more generally are effective targets for antiparasitic drugs.

The patriarchate is divided between a lay population of Palestinians and a hierarchy controlled by Greek monks. This division has been a source of struggle for over a century, and it can be traced both through the political history of Palestine/Israel and the deeper history of the Eastern church.\\n\\nFor decades now, researchers, journalists, activists, and clergy have struggled to understand this conflict and to resolve it, with little success. My doctoral research thus attempted to approach the subject from a different angle. My research suggests that the difficulties in understanding the church conflict are related to a broader analytical problem. The institutions of the Greek hierarchy on the one hand and Palestinian society on the other are frequently assumed to be opposed and independent, each always seeking to supplant the other in administration of the church patrimony - including its considerable real estate holdings. But I found this assumption to be incorrect. As it turns out, over the course of centuries of Ottoman rule, these institutions transformed in important ways, effectively merging the church and the Palestinian family into a single, unified whole. \\n\\nFollowing from these observations, my doctoral dissertation examines the merger of the family and the church in a number of different contexts, including canon law, property regulations, ritual experience, and hospitality relations. In doing so, I was able to begin establishing a more effective framework for understanding the conflict between the laity and the higher clergy. My thesis, however, stops short of applying this new framework to ongoing political disputes. \\n\\nIn the middle of my fieldwork, a new phase of the conflict erupted into the public sphere: Israeli newspapers published leaked documents outlining the sale and lease of several large tracts of church land to Israeli settlement organisations, developers, and the state. Protests of a scale not seen in years spread across the country and Palestinian activists launched a renewed campaign to depose the patriarch. I collected legal documents, interviewed activists and lawyers, and attended numerous conferences, protests, and press events to publicize the movement's aims and provoke the Palestinian public into action. \\n\\nNow that I have established a solid empirical basis for understanding the patriarchate's structure, I am prepared to begin addressing the political dynamics of the church more explicitly. My fellowship will thus not only consolidate my PhD research but also pivot towards larger political questions. I plan to do this by studying the literature on religious activist movements in the Middle East and the Orthodox Christian world, as well as on the religious property. I will work with my departmental mentor to apply my larger approach to the patriarchate's structure to the political discourses and behaviour of the activists, the clergy, and the state. \\n\\nTowards the end of the fellowship period, I will bring the different strands of my fellowship year together by organizing a workshop with a small number of specialists working on the patriarchate in different disciplines who all share an interest in addressing the current crisis. This will form the basis for a new field project in which I will return to Jerusalem after the fellowship year to investigate the property issue in more depth.\\nIn sum, the fellowship would provide me with a crucial transition period in which to share the findings of my PhD and establish myself as a researcher while also preparing for the next phase of my career, setting me up to pursue a long-term project that will make an impact both in the academy and the patriarchate itself.\", 'Understanding the mechanisms by which animals achieve complex navigational feats over long distances is an important challenge in the field of contemporary animal behaviour. In particular, the ways in which animals cognitively process, represent and utilise navigationally relevant information are of fundamental interest, with implications for the fields of animal learning, cognition and beyond. One crucial concept within animal navigation is the idea that animals use maps in order to navigate; this has been central to the field since Kramer (1953) suggested that animals use a map and a compass in order to navigate over long distances and Tolman (1948) introduced the concept of cognitive maps. Indeed, map concepts have been applied widely, to a range of navigational behaviours and beyond, with the cognitive representation of information which underpins non-spatial behaviours increasingly attributed to &quot;cognitive maps&quot;. Maps have long been recognised as being key in facilitating long-distance animal navigation, with a great deal of experimental research investigating the sensory basis of animal maps. We propose to use a variety of theoretical and experimental approaches to investigate the cognitive bases of map use in long-distance navigation and aim to move beyond the sensory basis of maps to consider the ways in which map information is learned and cognitively represented by animals. Neural network models will allow us to investigate the possible associative mechanisms by which animals learn to use map information.

The research will help forge complementary regional partnerships between the two universities and with Nottingham City Council and local heritage organisations who, with the wider community, will be the main non-academic beneficiaries of the project.\\n\\nFor the partner organisations it will facilitate hands-on experience of research, engagement with a rich field of knowledge, and create opportunities for knowledge exchange. Participants in a Gateway to Nature Framework project conference (which encourages involvement in green and nature-related activities for vulnerable members of the community) held in Nottingham in October 2012, stated that they were partly inspired by the historic ethos of Nottingham's green spaces. The project aims to capitalise on such community-led initiatives to raise awareness of the historic importance of green spaces and their surrounding communities, challenging both local people and visitors to the city to value and utilise them even more for recreation, education, research and scholarship. Through the development of networks and exchange of experiences it hopes to ameliorate tensions between preservation, heritage and community demands such as those demonstrated recently when one group concerned with preserving the Forest's heritage clashed with community groups wanting improved sports facilities.\\n\\nThe City Council faces many challenges managing and preserving Nottingham's historic green spaces which are used by diverse groups with different needs and expectations. It will benefit from the project in two ways. First, the project will build on and expand existing relationships with community groups and improve communication. Second, as part of a programme to promote understanding of Nottingham's historic green spaces, and inspire interest in their varied history, the project will provide a context for understanding the diverse landscapes including the planting schemes, the original buildings and the other structures, and how they are used. In a period of financial austerity and local government budget reductions, it will provide a useful source of information and inspiration for the work of gardeners, rangers and other parks staff, who are active in the friends groups, and aid the landscape-gardening, planting and management of Nottingham green spaces.\\n\\nFor local communities and local cultural consciousness, the project will enhance the sense of belonging and well-being implied in connecting the city with its green spaces, and provide the urban community with a cultural resource. For the wider community, the project will contribute to the regeneration ambitions of Nottingham City Council which rely on the active participation of local and regional leaders in the public and private sector. Overtures to these leaders to discuss the results of the project will secure lasting impact because of their resulting contribution to city planning and policy making. As well as providing the benefits of new knowledge for the wider community, it will create potential for economic benefit in the region through tourism. By placing Nottingham's Victorian parks, gardens, cemeteries and public walks into the context of the city's industrial and urban history, the intention is to build on and link to the city's wider regeneration strategy, which links directly to its tourism and heritage strategy, including regeneration of the Castle Quarter; Professor Beckett is a member of the working group preparing a major HLF bid for this area.\\n\\nIn these various ways, the project will have an impact among conservationists, heritage and museum specialists, local history enthusiasts, and people interested in the wider aspects of landscape design, conservation and history, not least some of the thousands of contemporary users of historic green spaces.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research. This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', \"Platelets play a critical role in innate immunity (Page and Pitchford 2013); being recruited independently of other cell types (Cleary et al., 2019) and are also essential for efficient leukocyte recruitment to inflamed or infected lungs (Pitchford et al., 2005; Amison et al., 2018). Mechanisms by which platelets adhere and 'prepare' the surface of the respiratory endothelium for efficient leukocyte recruitment require greater understanding. The luminal side of the endothelium is coated by a glycocalyx structure that normally acts as a barrier to circulating cells. Significantly, platelet-dependent leukocyte adhesion to endothelium (as observed by intravital microscopy) can be inhibited by low molecular weight (LMW) heparin (Riffo-Vasquez et al., 2016). LMW heparin can inhibit the binding of pro-inflammatory mediators to the glycocalyx (Lipowsky &amp; Lescanic 2017). Uniquely as a circulating cell, platelets contain the CXC chemokine PF4 (CXCL4). PF4 binds with high affinity to heparin, a highly sulfated glycosaminoglycan (GAG), and to negatively charged cell surface GAGs (e.g. heparan sulfate) of the glycocalyx (Loscalzo et al., 1985; Petersen et al., 1995; Sachais et al., 2004). It has been postulated that the activity of PF4 appears to involve binding to surface GAGs (Kowalska et al., 2010). However, the role of PF4 in platelet preparation of the glycocalyx for leukocyte recruitment, and an understanding of the surface chemistry by which heparin can interfere has not been examined, even though the modification of pulmonary endothelial glycocalyx is necessary during lung injury arising from infection (Schmidt et al., 2012).\\nThe National Institute of Biological Standards and Controls (NIBSC), have a unique panel of non-anticoagulant modified heparins and related polysaccharides that have anti-inflammatory properties (Hogwood et al., 2019). Expertise from NIBSC will be necessary to allow the PhD student to probe the structure-activity relationship of platelet released PF4 binding to GAGs within the endothelial glycocalyx to promulgate cell adhesion and the use of these heparins is necessarily interconnected to later project objectives at KCL.\\nThis project requires an interdisciplinary approach, where the student will learn techniques in pharmacology/physiology (in vitro and in vivo functional assays), synthetic chemistry (creation of heparin analogues), electron microscopy (EM), stochastic optical resolution microscopy (STORM), and analytical structural chemistry approaches (eg. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, FTIR).\", \"Northumbria University applies knowledge from multiple disciplines, into digital security through the work of the Cyber Security Research Group (CSRG) - a cross university group that combines (i) technical research on biometric encryption, wireless sensor networks, web security protocols, sonification and image recognition, with (ii) human-centred work on usable security, privacy, trust and behaviour change. \\nOur work ensures that the individual disciplines optimise their contribution to their own discipline, while working together to understand the point of interaction; the different strengths and weaknesses of computers and humans and how they can best work together to defend the enterprise. \\nThe vision of this research group is to secure our digital tomorrow by maximising technological developments, understanding human cybersecurity behaviours and exploring the factors that influence behaviour change including design, law, policy and the social context. We seek to optimise our citizens behaviours as cyber-defenders as well as optimise our technology defences against intrusions. \\nNorthumbria's Digital Living theme provides an opportunity to integrate work across the computational &amp; behavioural sciences, law and design, particularly around secure Big Data &amp; IoT, personal security across the lifespan and building resilient smart cities (where we are currently working in partnership with Newcastle University and Newcastle &amp; Gateshead City Councils as part of the EPSRC funded Urban Living Partnership). In addition as part of the Health and Social Care multidisciplinary research theme, we are growing our research focusing on cybersecurity in the health and social care domains as they struggle to reconcile advances in personal informatics, AI and embedded wireless medical devices with outdated legacy systems, poor security behaviours and vulnerable populations. \\nWe will achieve this vision by (i) incorporating multiple disciplines to broaden our understanding of cybersecurity behaviours. This will include law, ethics, policy and design. (ii) exploring how best to facilitate cybersecurity behaviour change (iii) exploring the needs of diverse populations and designing for inclusivity. At the same time work will continue to (iv) build adaptive technology defences for access control, network intrusion detection and phishing detection - thus reducing the burden on users.\", \"This two-year research network interweaves urban studies, feminist geography and digital humanities to critically engage with the smart city agenda on women's safety and gender based violence (GBV). It is timely and innovative in approach by bringing together a multidisciplinary collective of feminist and urban geographers, ICT initiatives, feminist NGOs and media artists from UK and India. It shifts the debates around smart urban futures in the global north by focusing on highly marginalized and invisible subaltern citizens of the global south - GBV survivors living in slums and informal settlements of Delhi and Bengaluru. It identifies and addresses the faultlines in current smart city agendas, which seek to resolve key societal challenges of GBV through the technocratic rationality of crowdsourced safety apps.\\n\\nThis network draws upon urban studies debates to move away from a 'one size fits all' (Kitchin 2015) critique to examine the diversity of 'actually existing smart cities' (Shelton et. al. 2014) in India. It draws upon feminist geography debates on GBV as 'a form of political, institutional and economic violence' (McIllwaine 2013, 66) and combines the liminality of cyberspace with that of everyday corporeality (Madge and O'Connor 2005) to enable an embodied and gendered approach to the smart city. It uses digital humanities methods to develop the notion of a 'data body' (Critical Art Ensemble 1995) - a virtual entity that is unencumbered by the real and imagined boundaries which structure and control women's everyday experiences with GBV. \\n\\nThe network activities will be delivered through two city stakeholder workshops in Delhi and Bengaluru which will share knowledge, build capacity and explore how their smart city agendas of creating safe and sustainable cities can be gendered through the voices, experiences and digital practices of GBV survivors. In particular, each workshop will explore how the existing big data on GBV collected from different sources can be creatively curated. The focus of each workshop will be an interactive digital installation on the gender smart city, co-produced by digital artists and GBV survivors. The network will culminate in a symposium and exhibition in London to foster long-term international collaborations on gendering the smart city across UK and India.\\n\\nThrough these activities, the network will answer three research questions. \\n1: How are smart city agendas addressing challenges of safe cities? We will examine smart city visions, policies, projects and technologies of Delhi and Bengaluru to understand how they aim to address GBV across public and private spaces and deliver on NUA and SDG goals on Gender Equality and New Technologies. \\n\\n2: What are the 'hotspots' and 'blindspots' of gendered big data on GBV? We will work with our societal partner, to examine the social and spatial unevenness of the gendered big data in their Safetipin app. This currently stands at crowdsourced safety audits of over 50,000 geolocations in Delhi and 10,000 in Bengaluru. We will focus particularly on the invisibility of this data in slums and informal settlements in both cities. in order to understand the reasons behind this we will engage with a range of stakeholders from smart city experts, law enforcement to grassroots GBV organisations.\\n\\n3: How can the data-driven smart city be gendered by GBV survivors? Through our networks in NGOs we will work with GBV survivors in slums by using digital humanities methods (such as networked narratives, garment testimonials, campaign hashtags and augmented mapping) to build specific capabilities for freedom as fundamental rights of all citizens (Nussbaum 2006). \\n\\nThe network outcomes will include a project website for knowledge exchange supported by regular social media engagements. Academic outputs include a special issue in a high-impact refereed journal and the development of long term collaborations through a larger research grant application.\", 'The SELFCITY project will explore the processes of self-organisation that underpin community-led project-based responses (in terms of both adaptation and mitigation) to climate change in three countries across Europe. Self-organising (i.e. the ways in which communities organise themselves) is one of the three inter-linked processes (along with market-led and state-led mechanisms) that underpin any pragmatic and innovative transition to an adapted urban environment that is closer to being carbon neutral and that may be more resilient to the challenges resulting from changing (climate-induced) weather patterns. In the past considerable work has been carried out on the role of market-led and state-led initiatives, however, we understand far less about the ways in which civil society constructs what are sometimes alternative and sometimes complementary ways of addressing climate change.\\nBuilding on existing research and practice on adapting the built environment, urban neighbourhoods and facilitating energy transition, the project will combine social researcher-led work with participant action research to explore, record and enhance the ways community activists are organizing innovative, creative and pragmatic climate change responses in their communities (of place and of space).\\nIt will set out how the problem(s) of climate change are understood both by these activists/practitioners and by the community members they work with. The project will create space for activists to identify capacity-building needs and for the research team to work with activists to fill these needs. Through these interactive and reflective activities the academic and practitioners teams will tease out the tensions and potentials of the inter-relation of everyday knowledge and technical knowledge on climate challenge responses. Not only does this project analyse the tensions in these forms of knowledge creation within a given national context, but it also uses cross-national comparison to help participants break out of culturally implicit (and fixed) constructions of both the climate change problem and the opportunities for change.', \"The aim of this project is to develop peptides that can be used to effectively inhibit formation of a toxic protein responsible for the pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD). The protein, known as alpha-synuclein (aS), self-associates \\ninside dopamine producing cells in the brain to form toxic clumps known as Lewy bodies that interfere with normal brain function and lead to the symptoms of the disease (Meade et al, Mol Neurodegen 2019: https://rdcu.be/bLohx; \\nMeade et al NPJ Parkinson's disease 2020). The PhD program will focus the student on inhibiting this process building from a system that we have already demonstrated to work (Cheruvara et al, J.Biol.Chem 2015). Using a novel screening \\nsystem that targets aS prior to any misfolding or aggregation, the student will screen large peptide libraries (&gt;2 Million members) inside living bacterial cells using a 'Transcription Block Survival' (TBS) assay. In this assay, inhibitors will only \\nbecome selected if DNA-binding activity is prevented, leading to a restoration of cell viability. \\nOur overarching aim is to assign function to specific sequence elements within our newly generated inhibitors to demonstrate the principles of rational inhibitor design, ultimately improving the properties of future peptide \\ngenerations. To achieve this the student will use the TBS assay to generate numerous inhibitory peptides to block the very first steps in the misfolding of aS. This will provide a wide range of sequences from which we can understand the \\nmechanism of inhibition using biophysical, neuronal cell-based methods. The project will also involve work with Bristol University and the application of high-resolution NMR to probe structures and interactions of the peptides with aS, \\nproviding valuable structural biology expertise. Finally, by comparing endogenously produced peptides against externally added peptides, the student will begin to explore aspects of drug delivery, such as permeability and the \\nability to reach intracellular targets. \\nThe composition of the supervisory team ensures comprehensive expertise in all facets of this interdisciplinary project. You will find a supportive and stimulating training environment, to guide you through the challenges and rewards of \\nthis project while gaining a wide range of skills that are translatable to many other systems.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research. This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', 'Much of what we know about how cells function, how they communicate and process information and how they transport essential elements and molecules has come from the application of electrophysiological approaches. The most well known example of this is the pioneering work of Hodgkin and Huxley, carried out at the Marine Biological Association (MBA) with the giant nerve fibre of the squid which led to the discovery of how nerve cells transmit impulses and formed the basis of much modern neurobiology.\\n\\nSince these seminal discoveries the field of electrophysiology has expanded dramatically and electrophysiological approaches are applied in the biomedical, biotechnological and discovery science fields to to gain molecular level understanding of a wide range of processes in cells ranging from medical disorders to plant growth and development and global ecological processes. For example, researchers at the Marine Biological Association continue to use and develop electrophysiological and optical methods applied in investigations of the evolution of electrical excitability in primitive unicellular marine organisms to understanding the cellular basis of carbon fixation in marine phytoplankton, important in the contexts of marine ecology and global climate regulation.\\n\\nIn 1984 it was decided that there was a need for an annual research workshop to provide training in the varied uses of microelectrode techniques. This has proven to be a very valuable contribution to cell biology and biophysics and has had significant impact on the training of new generations of cell physiologists. The MBA was chosen as the venue for this workshop since it provided both excellent workshop facilities and a continuing tradition of microelectrode and associated biophysical approaches in cell biology. The workshop has continued uninterrupted since then and is now recognized worldwide as one of the leading advanced research workshops in this field having provided advanced training to more than 500 early career scientists.\\n\\nThe need to train the new generation of electrophysiolgists continues, particularly with the increased emphasis on functional characterisation of membrane proteins and a wide range of cell biological areas. The workshop continues to be over-subscribed with applications 3-4 fold each year for the 20 places available. To meet this continuing need the proposed 5-year extension to the ongoing workshop will provide training in both the basic principles and more advanced practical and theoretical aspects of electrophysiology. New approaches are planned to be incorporated over this period. The basic workshop fomat will continue with a core of teaching and demonstrating staff recruited mainly from research laboratories in the UK and Europe along with an intensive series of talks and demonstrations from invited international experts. The workshop also benefits from the good relations that have been established over 30 years with a large number of commercial instrument manufacturers that ensures significant in-kind contributions of equipment and the provision of their expertise as instructors.', \"This innovative and timely project uses theatre practice and cultural geography to examine the socio-spatial implications of performance work delivered in domestic settings. In the 2016 AHRC report on 'Understanding the Arts and Cultural Value', Crossick and Kaszynska write that 'the home is where most engagement with cultural activities takes place and yet it is virtually ignored in discussions about their impact'. This interdisciplinary project between Geography and Performance Studies responds to such contentions, seeking to re-frame the home as a place of significant creative and cultural activity.\\n\\nUtilising archival research the first phase of this study offers a geohistorical analysis of the practice of home performance in the UK, exploring the ways in which the physical architecture and geographies of home are challenged by performances within it. Uniquely, the second phase of this research tests a set of theoretical observations against practical theatre making in a domestic space by employing two established family models for home performance developed by The Institute for the Art and Practice of Dissent at Home and Footprints Theatre Trust in my own home.\\n\\nThe third phase addresses how the complex territory of home might be navigated by artists and venues stepping beyond public art spaces to develop work in domestic settings. Working with the Nottingham Playhouse and Coventry University alongside Edgewick Primary School and charities Home Start and Carriers of Hope, this research explores how two international models for home theatre including the Chicago Home Theater Festival and Internacional de Cenas em Casa might be utilised to reach and engage people that, for socio-economic reasons, are unable to attend performances in theatre settings. The study aims to draw upon the networks and support made possible by the recent designation of Coventry as UK City of Culture and Nottingham as a UNESCO City of Literature.\", 'Apicomplexans contain a unique family of pore forming proteins named perforin-like proteins (PLPs). These are related to well-known effectors found in the immune system including perforin and the complement system which use pore formation on biological membranes as a means of attacking invading pathogens. Many copies of the pore forming protein must bind to the membrane and interact to form a circular pore shape, after which they rearrange to insert themselves into the membrane and punch out a ring of lipids. Apicomplexans are a family of parasites which must travel through cells during infection to complete their lifecycle. PLPs are secreted by the parasites and modify the host cell membrane in a way that allows the parasite to gain entry to and swim through the cell. However, the mechanisms underlying this activity are not currently understood. This project aims to determine the pore forming activity of PLPs, and understand how they facilitate this novel cell traversal activity using structural, biophysical and computational techniques.\\n\\nBBSRC priority areas:\\n\\nThis project seeks to understand the molecular mechanisms behind a new family of pore forming proteins, which are of particular interest due to their ability to transition from a soluble monomeric to transmembrane state. Knowledge of these proteins also contributes to our understanding of pathogen biology as they act on cellular membranes to allow whole parasites to enter into and travel through cells. \\n\\nPore forming proteins have potential wide-ranging biotechnological applications due to their ability to create a pathway for delivery of molecules through biological membranes, with particular applications in biosensing and biotherapeutics. Their study could help to refine our understanding of the pore forming process, to identify new candidates and methods of application in biotechnology.\\n\\nIn addition to the fundamental biological questions these proteins pose, their study also has practical implications, as the apicomplexan parasites infect a range of mammals. Several members of the apicomplexan phylum are major causes of illness and abortion in livestock. As such, these parasites have a huge impact on the productivity and profit of livestock farming worldwide, as well as affecting pets and wild animals. Study of PLPs has focused on the model apicomplexan organisms Toxoplasma and Plasmodium, however PLPs are found throughout the family and may have similar mechanisms of action. Knockout of PLPs in studies performed so far have led to significant reduction in pathogen virulence, therefore understanding the mechanisms of action of PLPs has the potential to provide new strategies for therapy. My project will focus on determining the basis for membrane attack by a Toxoplasma PLP comparing it to one from Plasmodium vivax and then moving towards a study of PLPs from Babesia and Theileria, Apicomplexans which are significant pathogens of livestock.', \"Hot-water drilling is widely accepted to be the most viable method of creating deep boreholes through ice sheets rapidly and cleanly. Up to now, this process is still widely being undertaken 'blind' with little or no information made available to the drillers about the precise trajectory that a borehole is taking as it descends deeper into the ice. The negative consequences of doing this, especially when closely separated boreholes are involved, became evident after the ill-fated first attempt at drilling into Subglacial Lake Ellsworth (SLE). To help rectify this urgent need, the technological development in this project seeks to realise a novel application of phase-sensitive frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) radars with an active transponder, to measure from the ice surface the spatial position inside a borehole with centimetre-precision to depths of up to 3-km. It significantly builds upon the successful ApRES radar which has been recently designed and field proven for year-long, high precision measurement of Antarctic ice shelf basal melt rates. \\n\\nThe concept of 1D-spatial location using the proposed technique of new phase-sensitive FMCW radars with active transponders is presently at the TRL2 level, in which the basic principles have been observed and reported; and a technology concept has been formulated based on the investigators' recent work at UCL. We now aspire to carry out research to take that concept to TRL4 and validate the technology for 3D-spatial location within a laboratory and outdoor setting. Once realised, the proposed technology could ultimately increase the likelihood of success in future attempts at gaining entry into SLE and other deep (&gt;3000-m) subglacial environments to open up new avenues of scientific exploration. The availability of such an instrument would also address the immediate needs of researchers on both the BEAMISH and CryoEgg NERC-funded projects, who are both seeking an independent method of obtaining spatio-temporal datasets at specific locations at the ice-bed interface and the broader subglacial environment, respectively. The new experimental data provided by the proposed instrument will lead to improved fundamental understanding of the dynamics occurring beneath the polar ice sheets and sustain and boost the status of UK research in these areas to internationally-leading standards.\", \"The stratification of fluids in layers of different densities is a well-known phenomenon in nature. Waves can propagate at the interface between two superposed layers. Examples are the interfacial waves which occur at a sharp interface between two layers of water of different densities due to the variation in salinity. There are experimental observations of the so-called ``dead-water'' effect in oceans and of narrow V-wakes behind the ships in synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) images, which may be explained by presence of the interfacial waves interacting with the free surface.Both the interface and the free surface are unknown, and have to be found as part of the solution. The problem of finding these interfaces belong to the class of free boundary problems, which occur in many physical and biological applications. The wave system at the interface or at the free surface is determined by a surface-wave mode and an internal-wave mode. The presence of the free surface was usually neglected when the interfacial waves were investigated. The nonlinear coupling between the free surface and interface makes the problem much more difficult. We will study different types of nonlinear waves which may exist when the free surface is not neglected. The effect of the surface tension and interfacial tension will also be considered and the existence of different types of solitary waves will be in particular investigated in two and three dimensions. Fully nonlinear codes will be developed to tackle these problems. Time-dependent algorithms are planned to be developed to explore the stability of different types of steady waves computed in two and three dimensions.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research. This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', \"All cells contain a complete copy of the organism's DNA, packaged into chromosomes. Before cells can divide, their chromosomes must be duplicated. This is called DNA replication and begins at specific sites on the chromosome called origins. Bacteria have a single replication origin but organisms with large chromosomes, such as humans, need many origins. We have found that in one case, origins are unnecessary and that cells without them can grow faster than normal.\\n\\nOur research on DNA replication was carried out in Haloferax volcanii, a member of the archaea. The tree of life is split into three groups: eukaryotes, bacteria and archaea. Archaea are microbes renowned for living in extreme conditions. Haloferax volcanii comes from the Dead Sea, we chose it because the enzymes that carry out DNA replication in archaea are similar to those in eukaryotes, such as human cells.\\n\\nHaloferax volcanii uses three origins to replicate its chromosome but when all origins are deleted, the cells grow faster. Doing these experiments in humans would be impossible. When origins are deleted from eukaryotes or bacteria, DNA replication is prevented and cells die. So how is Haloferax volcanii able to survive?\\n\\nCells without origins use a process called recombination to start DNA replication. Recombination is a form of DNA repair that is used to mend breaks in the chromosome. We found that recombination starts DNA replication at random locations on the chromosome, instead of at specific origins. But if this alternative mode of DNA replication using recombination is more efficient, why have origins at all?\\n\\nIn a sister species of archaea called Haloferax mediterranei, origins cannot be eliminated. When this is attempted, a dormant replication origin becomes active. This means that Haloferax mediterranei needs origins, while Haloferax volcanii can instead use recombination to start DNA replication. Why do these two closely-related microbes behave so differently?\\n\\nWe propose that Haloferax volcanii has critical genes that are missing from Haloferax mediterranei, or vice versa. To simplify the search for these critical genes, we will study the genomes of these and up to 20 additional Haloferax species. Our colleagues in Romania have already discovered that salt lakes in Transylvania are a rich source of Haloferax species. We will test these Haloferax species to see if their origins can be eliminated (as in Haloferax volcanii) or if they are essential (as in Haloferax mediterranei). Then we will compare their genomes to locate the genes responsible.\\n\\nAt the same time, we will examine the consequences of using recombination to start DNA replication.\\n\\nHaloferax volcanii can use recombination to start DNA replication but this may be hazardous. We will test whether it leads to mutations or chromosome rearrangements, and whether there are alternatives that avoid recombination.\\n\\nUnlike origins, recombination can take place anywhere on the chromosome, but how often this happens depends on the length of DNA. We will test if there is a minimum size of chromosome for this alternative mode of DNA replication.\\n\\nOur work will contribute to human health by increasing our understanding of cancer. What we have discovered in Haloferax volcanii has parallels with cancer cells. Haloferax has many copies of its chromosome, this is called polyploidy and helps it to survive when replication and cell division are not coordinated. Cancer cells often have mutations in the genes that control DNA replication and polyploidy is a common feature of cancer. Another consequence of uncoordinated replication is that cancer cells grow faster than ordinary cells. This is similar to the faster growth we observe with origin-less Haloferax volcanii, which use an alternative mode of DNA replication.\", 'Abstracts are not currently available in GtR for all funded research. This is normally because the abstract was not required at the time of proposal submission, but may be because it included sensitive information such as personal details.', \"This project aims to compare the energy used in traditional foundry processes and a novel single shot foundry technology, CRIMSON, and to develop a model of the processes that encapsulates the energy content at each stage. This model can then be used to persuade casting designers to use more energy-efficient processes which consider casting quality as well as design flexibility. The UK retains a globally recognised casting expertise, in copper, aluminium and new light-metal alloys that underpins many competitive, technology-based industries vital to keep the UK's aerospace and automotive base ahead of the competition. These industries draw on advanced R&amp;D work carried out by Birmingham's high-profile Casting Research Group.The University of Birmingham has been at the leading edge of casting R&amp;D for many years. Today, it is internationally acknowledged as a front runner, and the CRIMSON technique - Constrained Rapid Induction Melting Single Shot method - is one such technology which is helping the casting industry make a step-change in product quality, manufacturing responsiveness and energy use.A typical light-metal foundry will tend to work in the following way: from 100 kg to several tonnes of metal is melted in a first furnace, held at about 700 oC in a second, transferred into a ladle and finally poured into the casting mould. It can take a shift (8 hours) to use all the melt in a typical batch and any leftover unused melt is poured off to be used again, or becomes scrap. Quality issues also arise, which must be mitigated: during the time for which the melt is held at temperature, atmospheric water is reduced to hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is highly soluble in the metal at this temperature, but as the casting cools and solidifies, the gas is ejected into bubbles. The bubbles become porosity in the solid casting and have a detrimental effect on performance, therefore, as much gas must be removed as possible from the melt. The oxygen forms a thin layer of oxide on the melt surface, which is then inevitably entrained in the liquid metal when it is transferred between the different furnaces and when the metal is finally poured. The oxide layer (or bi-film) is now an inclusion which, again, has a detrimental effect on the material properties. The longer the metal is held liquid, the more hydrogen is absorbed and the thicker the oxide becomes on the surface.At each stage of the process there are energy losses due to oxidation and furnace inefficiencies, casting yields and eventually scrap. So from an initial theoretical 1.1 GJ/tonne required tomelt aluminium it is possible to estimate that each tonne of aluminium castings shipped will actually use about 182 GJ/tonne.Instead of going through this batch process, the CRIMSON method uses a high-powered furnace to melt just enough metal to fill a single mould, in one go, in a closed crucible. It transfers the crucible into an up-casting station for highly computer-controlled filling of the mould, against gravity, for an optimum filling and solidification regime. The CRIMSON method therefore only holds the liquid aluminium for a minimum of time thus drastically reducing the energy losses attributed to hold the metal at temperature. With the rapid melting times achieved, of the order of minutes, there isn't a long time at temperature for hydrogen to be absorbed or for thick layers of oxide to form. The metal is never allowed to fall under gravity and therefore any oxide formed is not entrained within the liquid. Thus higher quality castings are produced, leading to a reduction in scrap rate and therefore reduced overall energy losses.The first challenge in the project is to measure accurately the energy used at each stage in each of the processes investigated and to calculate the energy losses from oxidation and scrap. The second challenge is to incorporate this information into a model that can be used by casting designers and foundry engineers.\", \"&quot;**AMBITION:** Our aim is to reduce and replace the use of single use packaging for liquids, sauces and gel sachets through the development, scale up and roll-out of our natural, fully biodegradable plastic alternative technology Ooho- a unique, patented, seaweed-derived membrane material.\\n\\n**FOCUS:** Having perfected the strength, structure and shelf-life of our membrane technology in 2017, we now need to develop the advanced production hardware and machinery to manufacture and fill single-use sachets on an industrial scale in order to meet demand -- replacing current laminated aluminium and plastic packaging for condiments (sauces, salad dressings), gels (energy gels) and cosmetics (shampoo, conditioner) up to 50mL.\\n\\nOur alginate material has the potential to be as cheap as plastic and aluminium at scale as input material however difficulties in the manufacturing process, requiring significant human intervention, restrict our maximum production capacity to 300 Oohos/day - meaning that despite strong commercial interest, we are unable to meet the volume demanded by restaurants, take aways and retailers in a cost-competitive manner.\\n\\nAs part of our long-term growth strategy, our goal is to develop an method (hardware and production process) to manufacture Oohos, packaging range of single-use liquids on an industrial scale, in a consistent, high quality, low cost manner required by both suppliers (Heinz, Unilever, Lucozade) and customers (Just Eat, Selfridges,Sky).\\n\\n**APPROACH:** Working with partner, Just Eat the project focuses on overcoming the technical difficulties associated with designing and developing a unique, automated, machine to manufacture and fill 3000 Oohos sachets/day with a variety of condiments/sauces, without compromising structural integrity or consistence of the packaging membrane.\\n\\nOur alginate packaging is naturally sourced, biodegradable, robust (thanks to the previous IUK project) and is even edible. The only issue holding back its adoption is our ability manufacture and fill the membrane on an industrial scale.\\n\\n**SIGNIFICANCE:** The UK throws away over 300m plastic and aluminium single-use sachets (2ml-50ml) each year (Unilever;2017), with less than 9% ever recycled (National Geographic;2017). due to their disposable nature and plastic-aluminium composition.\\n\\nIn line with UKGOVs 'Plastic Pact' 2025 commitment, by developing manufacturing at scale capability, seaweed membrane will be cost-competitive with that of plastic/aluminium sachets and packaging, enabling retailers to adopt out technology for single-use liquid items. This in turn will save considerable CO2 in waste, reduced transport costs, plastic production and enable us to take advantage of global interest in the technology, spearheading the use of natural, plastic alternatives.&quot;\", \"Across the UK around 2 million people use adult mental health services every year, and because of the coronavirus pandemic around 1.3 million people were shielded and had to isolate themselves completely.

Melanin is synthesised and stored in membrane bound organelles called melanosomes. Melanosomes are found in melanocytes of the skin and also in cells of the eye, including in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. RPE cells lie immediately beneath the rods and cones (the cells of the eye that detect and transduce light). Deficit of melanin pigment, as is found in the various types of albinism, leads to severe visual impairment. Some types of albinsm are caused by defects in the ability to synthesise melanin while others are caused by defects in the ability to make melanosomes. The mechanisms whereby melanosomes are formed are not fully characterised but they involve the endocytic pathway, which is the route where by extracellular molecules like viruses and nutrients are taken up into the cell. Extracellular molecules are delivered to endosomes where they meet proteins that have been newly synthesised by the cell. From the endosome proteins may be delivered to many different places, such as the lysosome for degradation or back to the cell surface. We have shown that this critical decision is taken in multivesicular endosomes/bodies (MVB). Proteins that are to be delivered to the lysosome for degradation are sorted onto the internal vesicles of MVB while proteins that are to be returned to the plasma membrane stay on the perimeter membrane of the MVB. In melanin synthesising cells the MVB may also be involved in delivering melanosomal proteins to the melanosome or a subpopulation of MVBs may develop into melanosomes. In melanin producing cells a protein called pmel 17 is required for the generation of internal striations within the forming melanosome upon which melanin is deposited. In the very early stages of melanosome formation pmel17 is found on the internal vesicles of MVBs and when sufficient protein has accumulated on the internal vesicles of MVB striations begin to form. Striations will even begin to form within the MVBs of cells which do not normally make melanin if they are genetically modified so that they make pmel17. This implies that inward vesiculation within MVB may play a critical role in formation of internal striations and in melanosome biogenesis. Recently components of the molecular machinery that are involved in sorting of proteins within MVB and in MVB formation have been identified. We have been determining the function of some of these proteins using electron microscopy (EM), as EM is the only way to visualise the very small (50nm diameter) internal vesicles of MVB. So far we have determined the functions of some of these proteins in cells which do not make melanosomes. We now propose to determine the role of these proteins in the formation of melanosomes in melanocytes and RPE cells. In addition to determining the role of the core components of the MVB machinery we will determine the role of a protein that is only expressed in cells that make melanosomes. OA1 is the protein which is defective in the most common type of ocular albinism and patients with this disease can make melanin but make a reduced number of unusually large melanosomes. This protein has been found associated with MVBs and has been proposed to play a role at the level of the MVB in melanosome formation. We will use our EM assays to determine what OA1 does within the MVB. Together these studies will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms regulating the formation of an organelle which is the body's natural defence mechanism against the effects of the sun and which also plays an important role in vision. This will help us to understand how these mechanisms fail in human disease.\", \"The last year I have been working on a scenario where the luminosity at the ATLAS experiment becomes high enough that we need to apply harsher cuts on the trigger selection. I used a sample of background QCD jets (events we don't want to keep) and a sample of electrons from Z bosons (that we do want to keep) to reduce the rate of data-taking but keeping the efficiency as high as possible. A set of cuts were thus deduced and have been placed in the trigger menu which may be used for this year's running of the LHC.\\nI am further involved with an analysis on top-antitop quark charge asymmetry. Here we are looking at the decay products of the two particles and observing their respective boosts (rapidities) in the detector to see if their values differ from those predicted by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. Some models beyond the Standard Model predict different behaviour. Currently, I am comparing methods which reconstruct the top quarks from their decay products, seeing how well they perform, using Monte-Carlo data to test them.\\nMy main thesis topic is yet to be decided but will be a larger analysis on top quarks, perhaps even a continuation of charge asymmetry with all of the LHC run 2 data.\", \"Food Stories partners academic expertise with a young social enterprise Stories On Our Plate (SOOP) to foster cross-cultural understanding through cooking, eating food, and sharing stories of culinary heritage and cultural identity. This will be done via a series of creative knowledge exchange, public engagement and active dissemination activities - cooking workshops, a SOOP cookbook, and caf&eacute;-style cookbook launch seminars. It follows on from Consuming Authenticities (CA), which investigated how narratives about history, origins and traditions invested four particular food and drinks with problematic ideas of authenticity and explored notions of culinary heritage and its relationship to cultural identity. Key outputs from CA included: a recipe book aimed at a popular audience that included personal culinary narratives about foods and drinks from Mexico, Brazil, Cyprus and the UK; a participants' workshop that invited consumers and producers of the foods and drinks to share their experiences; and a recipe book launch event in which participants shared their food and its stories. Emerging from these activities and their impact assessment was a strong message that telling stories about culturally salient food and culinary heritages, as well as sharing that food, could help foster cross-cultural dialogue and understandings of diversity and commonality. Food, and food stories, became the vehicles for translating the histories and cultures of different parts of the world to one another. It further encouraged reflection among participants to value their own culinary heritage as part of their identity. \\nThis reflection and self-valorisation is particularly relevant in the context of diasporas and migrant groups, and is particularly prescient in the current political climate, which has seen a rise in anti-migrant and refugee rhetoric and increasingly entrenched divisions across the United Kingdom, particularly in cities such as Bradford and Coventry and across specific London boroughs, such as Dagenham &amp; Redbridge, Waltham Forest, and Barking. Food Stories focuses its public engagement activities on these locations as they appear to be multi-cultural, cosmopolitan and diverse, and are built on migration and migrant communities, but their diversity divides as much as unites. There is hence an urgent social need to promote cross-cultural understanding in such divided communities. As CA established, learning about food traditions, exchanging historical and personal narratives about food and culinary heritage, is a particularly effective means of achieving such intercultural dialogue and understanding. \\nThe project partner, SOOP, was founded with the aim of creating spaces, through the sharing of food and food stories, through which negative perceptions of migrants and refugees could be challenged and dialogue fostered. Through a series of supper clubs, culinary training programmes and public engagement seminars, SOOP has worked in London to empower migrant groups by facilitating the sharing of culinary heritages. Their experiences echo the findings of CA, in respect that food can be a mechanism for enhancing cross-cultural understanding. Partnering with SOOP to transfer the knowledge gained from CA, then, strengthens the original project's impact by:\\n - applying its findings to reach new audiences through a series of collaborative public engagement activities\\n - using the knowledge gained from publishing a recipe book to practically support the publication and active dissemination of a SOOP cookbook\\n - facilitating dialogue on culinary heritage, food and migration with community leaders, migrant and refugee groups, food writers and the food industry, local Government officials and activists\\n - building capacity among community leaders and activists by providing them with the tools to use food and culinary heritage as a mechanism for challenging prejudice and encouraging cross-cultural dialogue within their own communities.\", \"Algae hold great promise for the large scale production of carbon-neutral biofuels that avoid many of the problems of terrestrial biofuels (such as Palm Oil) in that they require only about 10% of the space of terrestrial crops and can use waste water for growth and their nutrients. Current production systems are, however, uneconomic against both fossil and first generation biofuels and require significant step wise improvements to redress this. There are opportunities for improvements in the cost effectiveness of both upstream production and downstream processing of algae to close the gap between algal biofuel and fossil fuels but these will require radically different approaches from those currently employed.\\n\\nThis feasibility study project will be a collaboration between Xanthella, a biotechnology SME based in Oban who produce compact, efficient algal photo bioreactors, and a team of physicists at the University of St Andrews who are experts in optical materials and photophysics. The project aims to deliver a step change in the performance-cost ratio of algal photo bioreactors (PBRs) operating under solar illumination for the production of carbon neutral biofuels. This will be achieved through the development of an innovative solar light collection component for use in Xanthella's internally-lit photobioreactor designs.\", 'In this project, you will develop and apply chemical and biochemical tools to help to identify and characterize at the molecular level the protease(s) responsible for proteolytic processing of splicing components. This could reveal novel druggable targets and an alternative approach to modulate splicing indirectly, independent from targeting the RNA.', 'Bacteria are microscopic free living organisms that are found nearly everywhere on earth, including in the human body. Their actions have big impacts on the environment at all levels and they also affect human health and happiness. Bacterial cells are organised in a different way to animal cells, notably with respect to how they handle their DNA. In animal cells, the DNA is packaged into individual chromosomes that are kept in a separate membrane-bound compartment of the cell called the nucleus. For most bacteria, their DNA consists of millions of base pairs in a single chromosome that is free in the main cell compartment. This creates a logistic problem since bacterial cells are small and, in order to fit the DNA into the cell, it has to be highly compacted by folding. Microscopy studies have shown that, in many bacteria, the chromosome is restricted to a part of the cell called the nucleoid. We are interested in how proteins interact with bacterial chromosome DNA in order to compact it into the nucleoid, and over a dozen different proteins that contribute to the compaction have now been identified. Whilst we understand the actions of many of these proteins when bound at individual DNA targets, we have little idea how these proteins act together on a bigger scale to organise DNA in the bacterial nucleoid.\\n\\nThis proposal is prompted by the recent discovery of specific locations on the chromosome of a common bacterium, Escherichia coli, where the amount of bound protein is especially high. It has been suggested that these highly occupied targets act as the organising centres of the nucleoid by clustering together segments from different parts of the chromosome. It is thought that this clustering is essential to the compaction of the Escherichia coli chromosome and that similar mechanisms operate in most bacteria. Hence our aim is to identify the proteins that bind at these targets and start to build up a detailed protein occupancy map of the Escherichia coli chromosome. To achieve this, we will exploit a newly developed method called DNA sampling. Having identified the proteins that bind at different targets, we next want to build up a DNA proximity map by identifying chromosome segments that are far apart in the DNA sequence but clustered together in the 3-dimensional space of the nucleoid. One of the problems with doing this is that bacterial nucleoids are not fixed structures and each locus on the DNA may well make short-lived interactions with many other loci. Hence, to capture transient interactions, we will use a method called chromatin conformation capture, and, by combining it with high throughput sequencing, we will be able to record the different interactions. Taken together, this information will allow us to build up a picture of the different interactions that hold the Escherichia coli nucleoid together. \\n\\nFinally, we will investigate the possibility that the folding of gene DNA into a bacterial nucleoid affects its ability to be expressed. This is most likely because the folding restricts the accessibility of certain DNA elements that must be recognised by the proteins that initiate gene expression. We already have some preliminary data to show that this is the case for some of the regions of high protein binding. Hence, we are planning to use state-of-the-art fluorescence microscopy to find out where these transcriptionally silent loci are positioned in the nucleoid. These experiments will provide important information for modellers who want to predict patterns of expression from the DNA base sequence of any bacterium.', 'This project addresses the priority area of early detection of PD onset to allow timely administration of new treatments. \\n\\nThe main goal in this project is to develop and evaluate an artificial intelligence (AI)-based tool to analyse routine computer tomography (CT) brain scans in hospital libraries to detect PD onset before routine diagnosis. This will lead to a new way to detect people at risk of developing PD and to earlier diagnosis. \\n\\nPD is a common neurodegenerative disease (around 130, 000 people are affected in the UK, increasing by 2% per year). Currently, it is diagnosed on the basis of examination and movement disorder. \\n\\nWe believe CT brain changes can serve as radiological markers detectable before the onset of movement symptoms.

LINEs are a major class of retrotransposable elements and their functional roles are still poorly understood. Previous data from the Ule lab has identified a series of RNA binding proteins which are likely to be important regulators of LINE derived transcripts, but about which almost nothing is known. This project will focus on how LINEs and their binding proteins influence cellular decision making, particularly of cell fate decisions in brain development. We hypothesise that variation in LINEs between species has contributed to their divergent speciation.', 'Most stars form in dense groups where interactions with other stars are common. Furthermore, planets form at the same time as stars, and so any dynamical interaction a star undergoes is likely to affect planet formation. In this PhD, Emma Daffern-Powell is simulating the effects of stellar interactions on fledgling planetary systems. She will begin by determining whether the Solar System can capture a planet from another star, before looking at the general effects of the star-formation environment on a population of planets. Emma will then look at the effects of binary stars on planets, where the perturbative effects come from the stellar companion as well as passing stars.', 'The identification of new small molecule (hits or chemical probes) able to modulate difficult-to-target therapeutic proteins is still one of the major challenges for the biomedical community. These small molecules not only provide new understanding of biological targets and pathways related to a given disease (target identification/validation), but can also form the first step towards the development of a new medicine (hit identification). Conventionally, bioactive small molecules have been discovered by the screening of massive compound collections (commercial or academic), but, despite their enormous size, the probability of finding tractable hits against novel biological targets is reduced due to these collections only occupy restricted areas within the bioactive chemical space. Consequently, despite the significant economic resources and efforts devoted, hits resulting from these campaigns have limited chances of becoming clinical candidates. This project aims to address this problem by providing an innovative and efficient approach that combines the screening of a small diverse fragment library (generated on the basis of Diversity-Oriented Synthesis) through High-Throughput Crystallography (XChem facility at Diamond) against challenging proteins with the state-of-the-art techniques in computational chemistry (including artificial intelligence and deep learning technology) to identify and profile better-quality hits. This is a highly collaborative project that complies with the BBSRC remit; the success of this project will have a huge impact across bioscience research since this innovative approach can be applied to a wide range of biological targets.', 'To develop and embed a new Microbiology R&amp;D capability in order to enhance product development for existing and new markets.', 'Vira is motivated to make lives happier, healthier and more productive for the 1bn women worldwide (13m UK) coping with menopause. 80%+ report symptoms interfere with daily life and 50% say it has made work difficult or untenable, with 900k UK women quitting jobs annually. Symptoms include physical (hot flushes, weight gain, loss of libido) and psychological (mood swings, difficulty concentrating, depression, anxiety).

COVID-19 restrictions on shared spaces and physical contact now prevent them from working effectively. This project will reframe and customise conventional web-conferencing technologies to create innovative performance spaces, enabling collaboration in a shared online environment that we refer to as a telepresence stage. Real-time video images of remote performers are merged within virtual stage sets, so participants appear to co-exist in the same online space. This enables actors and dancers to simulate presence together from their homes, studios, theatres, or other remote locations to advance online creation, rehearsal and performance.\\nThe project team from media and performing arts backgrounds bring together their knowledge and experience of developing live networked performance research and practice for over 30 years. They will develop a Telepresence Laboratory between University of Brighton UK, Third Space Network Studios in Washington DC and LASALLE College of the Arts in Singapore, combining green- screen technology and virtual set design to enable full-body interactions between remote performers in shared online spaces. Eight UK performing arts groups will test, explore, and perform online techniques. These groups include youth theatre, dance companies, musical theatre and regional theatres, working from remote locations using standard computing and video resources. Each 4-month residency will culminate in a live-streamed public performance demonstrating unique telepresence solutions to be immediately disseminated via multiple easy- to-use PDF help guides, step-by-step video tutorials and open-source resources designed to assist UK performing arts professionals in returning to work regardless of lockdown restrictions.', 'Plant microbial pathogens destroy some 15% of crop production worldwide, inflicting major agricultural and socio-economic losses. Thus, understanding plant immunity is at the centre of efforts to mitigate the challenges in food production facing human society in the coming decades. Although plants have evolved defence systems, immunity comes at a cost to plant growth; crop bred to maximize growth-related traits, by contrast, often compromise on defense. To strategically maximize plant disease resistance, knowledge of the mechanisms underlying plant defences is vital to minimize reductions in yield. \\n \\nStomatal pores on the leaf surface exchange gas and water with the environment and are primary entry points for microbial pathogen. The initial defence against bacterial pathogen is stomatal closure, but pathogens commonly manipulate these defences and force stomatal opening. At a cellular level, these manipulations include commandeering ion transporters and their regulatory proteins to prevent stomata closure. Microbial pathogens also hijack cellular vesicle traffic to suppress secretion of defence-related molecules to the cell wall. Secretion at the plant plasma membrane is mediated by so-called SNARE proteins that assemble to drive the final stages of membrane vesicle fusion and deliver the vesicle contents to the cell wall and space outside the cell. Yet, the knowledge of molecular basis of these processes during plant pathogenesis is sparse and virtually nothing is known of their coordination.\\n \\nThe plasma membrane SNARE SYP132 has been associated with the secretion of antimicrobial peptides. Recently, I found that its expression and traffic within the cell are tied directly to bacterial infection. SYP132 expression, I observed, affects stomatal responses to bacterial pathogens. Furthermore, SYP132 interacts physically with the plasma membrane ion transporters and regulatory proteins that are essential for pathogen defence, and traffic of the SNARE appears to co-opt the ion transport proteins during pathogen infection. These findings point to an unexpected and central role for this SNARE as a key regulator of in stomatal defence and immunity.\\n \\nMy hypothesis is that SYP132 endocytosis and vesicle membrane recycling are critical for early stages of bacterial pathogenesis. SYP132 traffic and functions in immunity are particularly regulated by its interactions with the ion transporters and regulatory proteins at the plasma membrane and they allow for a co-ordination between defence signalling, antimicrobial secretion and stomatal responses to fight off disease and to regulate plant-microbe interactions.\\n \\nI propose to elucidate the mechanisms underlying SYP132 traffic and its impact on the transporter binding partners to resolve the impact on plant immunity. These studies will make use of established plant and pathogen models as a backdrop for the work. I will determine how interactions of SYP132, particularly with the ion transporter and regulatory proteins identified to date, change during the progression of bacterial disease. I will expand the studies with proteomic analysis of the SYP132 interactome and measurement of quantitative changes in SYP132 interactions with new and known partners during bacterial pathogenesis to assess their roles in SYP132-mediated immunity. The knowledge gained will inform future efforts in approaches to engineering crops with enhanced defence systems in sustainable agriculture.', \"Being able to communicate ideas in writing is a critical part of people's social and professional life. Underdeveloped literacy skills are likely to result in lower grades, diminished job prospects, and a lower quality of life. Yet over half a million UK adults have underdeveloped literacy skills which is more prevalent in groups from socio-economically deprived areas (Department for Education and Skills, 2007; PIAAC, 2013). My research will shape our understanding of how we communicate in writing, provides a foundation to isolate the needs of struggling writers, and hence will inform new ways how literacy difficulty in learners and struggling adults (with, for example, dyslexia) can be measured and how people with difficulty can be supported to provide equal opportunities for everyone. \\n\\nEven though we typically don't struggle to formulate a sentence in spoken conversation, struggling with word spelling can, literally, result in you forgetting what it was that you were going to say and how you were going to say it. This thinking is frequently advanced in the educationally-focussed writing literature. Surprisingly though, the evidence that this is the case - poor spellers often produce lower quality texts - is equivocal and explanations are limited.\\n\\nFrom a theoretical viewpoint, writing involves a cascade of mental processes that flows from our mind into our fingers. This cascade starts with an intended message, moves on to coming up with suitable words and a grammatically correct order, before finding the right spelling for these words, and finally outputting them onto paper or screen. When things are going well - when the writer knows what they want to say, has the vocabulary in which to say it, knows how the words are spelled, and has many hours practice at typing or handwriting - then this cascade permits remarkably fluent output. However, it is also relatively common for this smooth flow to be disrupted. This might happen, for example, when a writer struggles to remember the spelling for a word. This typically delays output or results in an incorrect word appearing on the screen. Arguably, neither of these are particularly serious issues. Much more serious is the possibility that spelling difficulty has knock-on effects for what we want to say and how we plan to put it. Anecdotally, at least, hesitating to output a word can, literally, result in you forgetting what it was that you were going to say.\\n\\nThe proposed research will (a) advance our understanding of how we coordinate the mental processes that allow us to express meaning in writing, and (b) inform the hypothesis that struggling with word spelling negatively impacts on our ability to formulate ideas in writing by (c) explaining in what way spelling difficulty reduces text quality. The project aims will be achieved by (1) establishing whether a fundamental property of sentences, namely word order, is used to accommodate writing hesitations, (2) assessing whether the use of sentence syntax is a direct result of spelling difficulties, and (3) exploring how these processes differ in young adults with genuine spelling difficulty. To draw conclusions about these objectives the project will conduct three series of experimental studies: I will ask participants to describe simple arrangements of pictures and relate their keyboarding (what is typed when) and eye-movement behaviour (which pictures are people looking at when they type what) to gain insight into the timecourse of how we encode what we see in writing. These data will be analysed with cutting edge statistical models to understand under which conditions text formulation is directly impacted by difficulty with word spelling.

Our objective is the science and engineering to provide highly manufacturable photonic integration technologies relevant to a wide spectrum of end-users - from data storage, to telecommunications, to biophotonics.\\nTo increase the capacity of hard disk drives for 'cloud' computing, new technology is required. Heat-assisted magnetic recording (HAMR), which uses electromagnetic energy to locally heat the disk to ease the process of writing data on to it, is favourite. HAMR requires integration of photonic components such as lasers, waveguides and plasmonic antennas into the recording head. This will drive low-cost photonic integration and plasmonic technology into other industries and applications.\\nStudents embark on a four year programme - with an emphasis of additional technical skills, management and leadership training in the outset before selecting their substantive research project in early summer of their first year.\\nThe programme will lead to a Doctoral degree jointly awarded by Queen's University Belfast and University of Glasgow.\", \"Reflections of microwave-frequency GNSS signals (GPS, Galileo) off the Earth can be collected by a satellite in low Earth orbit and used as a radar source to sense soil moisture, flooding, permafrost freeze / thaw state, ice and biomass; more precise information can be gained by using signal processing that looks for reflected signals that retain their phase coherency.\\n\\nSoil moisture is an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) closely associated with hydrology, weather, agriculture and climate change, and that has potential for improved measurement from space. GNSS Reflectometry has been demonstrated as a new Earth Observation technique, and Surrey's GNSS-Reflectometry instrument has been used on TechDemoSat-1, DoT-1 and NASA CYGNSS to measure ocean winds, and reflections are also retrieved over land and ice. SSTL leads a consortium in the ESA Scout HydroGNSS mission concept. \\n\\nGNSS Reflections retrieved over the Amazon show the unique property of highlighting rivers underneath the rain forest canopy. The resolution of GNSS reflections is assumed to be around 25 km over the ocean, but when there is a flat surface, the reflections become coherent, and the resolution approaches the Fresnel zone of about 500 metres. The improved resolution could help map jungle river over-banking (an important source of methane), and sea ice edges. Coherent reflectometry may improve freeze / thaw monitoring over permafrost, and open the door for altimetry using GNSS, and for target detection of objects with reflective surfaces.\\n\\nThe processing scheme currently used on the instruments assumes that signals are not coherent, but are incoherent, and crucial information such as carrier phase is not being collected. This PhD studentship will investigate alternative processing schemes for collecting coherent signals from GPS and the wider bandwidth Galileo signals. Raw data collected by TechDemoSat-1 can be used to test new signal processing schemes, and there is the potential for involvement and implementation of algorithms on the DoT-1 and HydroGNSS satellite missions.

In consequence, there are conspicuous sampling gaps of which the equatorial regions and most of the Indian Ocean are the most extensive. The southwest Indian Ridge (SWIR) is a major geological feature which extends from the central Indian Ocean to join the Mid-Atlantic Ridge in the Southern Ocean. It is rich in seamounts and supports a productive deep-water fishery yet, in terms of biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, it is one of the least sampled regions of the global ocean. We propose to study the diversity and distribution of benthic assemblages, from meiofauna to megafauna, on seamounts in the central section of the SWIR between 41 degrees S 42 degrees E and 33 degrees S 58 degrees E. The benthos of this region is completely unstudied and is of particular interest in terms of its position in relation to major ocean currents, gradients of primary productivity, and recent predictions as to the global distribution of cold-water corals. The region may be regarded as the most significant gap in our understanding of the seamount fauna globally. By studying the associations between faunal assemblages and habitat types, the genetic relatedness of populations, and the relationships between surface productivity, currents, and benthic distributions, we will enhance understanding of the processes governing the distribution, abundance, diversity and evolution of fauna on oceanic seamounts. A new habitat-suitability model based on environmental niche factor analysis (ENFA) has predicted that hard substrata in the southern Indian Ocean, down to ca. 2,500 m, are prime habitats for cold-water scleractinian corals. We propose to test these predictions by comparing the distributions and abundances of coral species across the study area with modelled distributions. Confirmation of the model predictions would lend support to recent concerns that increases in anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions are likely to cause range shifts in calcareous marine organisms. A recent initiative from the deep-sea fishing industry working with the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has proposed a number of voluntary benthic protected areas (BPAs) on the SWIR in which no bottom trawling will take place: three of these are within the proposed study area. This is an unprecedented event in international waters and presents a unique opportunity to study the effectiveness of BPAs in protecting deep-sea habitats and species in the high seas. Detailed information on fishing effort at the study sites, available through industry collaboration, will allow us to assess the effects of trawling on slow-growing deep-sea benthic assemblages, and to gather baseline information against which the process of recovery following cessation of fisheries can be assessed.', 'Our society relies on the chemical industry for the production of materials that assist and sustain our modern way of life. Manufacturing processes based on relatively simple chemical transformations are responsible for the production of drugs, pesticides, fuels and fertilisers, and it is quite common for these processes to be constructed around fundamental building blocks such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. A typical example is the Fischer-Tropsch (FT) process, which is one of the most popular gas-to-liquid processes and is used for the production of long chain hydrocarbons from carbon monoxide and hydrogen. Its national strategic importance is demonstrated by the significant investments made by British companies (e.g. Johnson Matthey, BP, Velocys) in the development of new catalysts and FT reactors for the conversion of urban waste and biomass into renewable fuels, which is in line with the UK Government strategy to increase the number of FT plants and synthetic fuel supply by 2030. However, costs associated with these types of chemical manufacturing processes are usually very high, as they often rely on expensive and toxic transition metal reagents, and require very high temperatures and pressures.\\n\\nEarth abundant and non-toxic metals promise cheaper and more sustainable alternatives for chemical manufacturing processes. However, reagents based on these metals cannot break apart many of the small molecules used by these processes because of their lack of redox reactivity. Nonetheless, in recent years there have been many developments towards the generation of redox active Group 2 reagents, leading to the report of the first monovalent beryllium, magnesium and calcium species. This field is still in its infancy and these new species are yet to deliver transformations comparable to those of the traditional transition metal systems used by the chemical industry. New approaches must be devised to discover more sustainable alternatives and cheaper reagents that can mimic the performance of transition metal catalysts. This project will investigate the fundamental properties of the Alkaline Earth family (with the exception of beryllium and radium); these are Earth abundant and non-toxic metals, which could one day provide more sustainable alternatives for current materials employed by the chemical industry.\\n\\nIn preliminary work we have demonstrated monovalent Alkaline Earth complexes can be stabilised with judicious and tailored molecular design. Our previous experimental and theoretical studies provide a blueprint that is transferrable to all the elements of the Group and will afford a new class of species in which the heavy Alkaline Earth metals possess transition metal-like electronic configuration, unlike previous examples of sub-valent Group 2 complexes. This is a first crucial step towards the preparation of Alkaline Earth reagents that will perform in redox reactivity in the same vein as classic transition metals employed in synthesis and catalysis. The repercussions of this are significant, both from the fundamental and applicative point of view. Group 2 elements are generally considered unable to behave like transition metals, and this project will provide the first experimental proof of viable molecular species where the electronic and chemical properties of the Alkaline Earth metals will parallel those of transition metals. The resulting compounds will be capable of transforming common gases used by the chemical industry (hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon monoxide), thus opening up new synthetic possibilities for improving the sustainability of chemical manufacturing processes.', \"This project will explore connections between experimental music practices with political and social agency for Middle Eastern female experimental music artists. Heya is a practice-based research project that uses collaborative methods to balance roles between researcher and subjects, and nonverbal communication inherent in musical composition provide an exchange of experience and knowledge not accessed by traditional research methods. Feminist musicologists exploring subjects like gender and noise and feminist performance, are almost exclusively limited to European and American subjects. Heya will investigate the cultural and sociological situation of women composers in the Middle East through composition, performance and community building. \\n\\nTara Rodgers' approach to feminist music discourse has sought to negate &quot;the reproduction of an existing cultural order&quot;. The language of computer culture (and therefor music production) continues to be embedded with words such as &quot;'master' and 'slave', 'controller', 'command', 'trigger' and 'bang'&quot;. There simply isn't an existing common language for decolonising electronic and experimental music in any real way. This lack of meaningful language has meant that feminist musicology and ethnomusicology and scholars of Arab modernism have mostly failed to merge to yield ontologies from experiences of women outside of the West who engage music practices.\\n\\nModernism and the 'avant garde' in the ME are often indistinguishable from political agency in the region. Existing online networks, readily accessed throughout the Middle East, expedite the transmission of music creating a transnational solidarity across the region. These networks stimulate an interest in 'alternative' musical forms (Anderson 2006, 57). Esoteric, experimental, noise and metal produced and distributed over the web (particularly on Youtube) or played live, either publicly or underground, are acts of &quot;rebellion&quot; and &quot;activism&quot; positioned against popular culture (and hegemony) or deterritorialization of institutional &quot;milieus&quot;. \\n\\nContemporary interdisciplinary discourse within ME women's studies is evolving and interdisciplinary. An understanding of relationships between gender, revolution and state building within the diverse social and political contexts since the Arab Spring and Iranian Green Movement (Persian Spring) in these predominantly Muslim countries (Egypt, Iran and Lebanon), will form an integral basis from which the collaborative work will be done. The revolutionary movements and responses by those in power in 2019 will have a significant impact on female artists in those regions and therefore on this research.\\n\\nThis project will explore developing a new decolonised descriptive language for electronic and experimental music composition which will in turn inform this project and discourse in the field and beyond. This matters and is theoretically significant because the language and methods used will generate essential (currently absent) knowledge in musicology, ME women's studies and music culture more broadly including the language of electronic music production. \\n\\nThe project will add to the limited number of comparative studies of women in the ME, bring to light the effects of modernism and globalisation on gender roles in the ME, and make a significant contribution to knowledge about women in the ME and their relationship with technology and global networks. The academic audience for Heya includes practice based researchers, ethnomusicologists, musicologists.\\n\\nMusical projects emerging from the ME such as Egyptian Female Experimental Music, Parallel Persia and Experimental Music from Iranian have already attracted attention in European media. Heya will be of interest to a very broad audience through platforms such as CTM Berlin, Mutek, NTS Radio, Resident Advisor, The Wire, The Guardian and Quietus, which have all featured similar projects, though often with a predominantly male artist bias.\", \"Imperial is a global research-driven university that supports an atmosphere and culture that encourages discovery and innovation without boundaries. Guided by our mission of achieving enduring excellence, in research and education, in science, engineering, medicine and business for the benefit of society; our strategy to contribute to the global challenges ahead is to focus our research around four themes: these are discovery and the natural world; engineering novel solutions; health and well-being; and leading the data revolution. \\nOur tremendous strength in the core disciplines practiced by our academic departments was demonstrated in the 2014 Research Excellence Framework in which over 90% of the research submitted by Imperial was judged to be world-leading or internationally excellent. Combined with our emphasis on multidisciplinarity, collaboration and the extensive support and infrastructure provided by our Graduate School, this provides an excellent PhD training environment. In addition to being supported in the acquisition of high level research skills, our students are provided with a wide diversity of opportunities to exploit our world-class research capabilities to become leaders in their chosen field. \\nOver 75% of our postgraduate students are working in the EPS disciplines which are core to Imperial. The excellence of Imperial's postgraduate training landscape is indicated by the high percentage (91.7% - compared to the Russell group average of 91.5%) of postgraduate leavers joining the work or study sectors, according to the 2013-14 Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education survey. \\nImperial invests its DTP funding in supporting Excellence - see The Imperial College PhD Scholarships Scheme, supporting Early Career Researchers through the Doctoral Prizes Scheme - See https://www.imperial.ac.uk/research-and-innovation/funding-opportunities/internal-funding-opportunities/ and to support our research-led education see http://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop \\nHowever, the bulk of our EPSRC resources are used to provide the responsive and flexible support needed for underpinning our core disciplines (particularly theoretical subjects) or for developing emerging areas outside the remit of our Centres for Doctoral Training. Thus the flexibly allocated DTP student cohort is the lifeblood of our research base - sustaining our future ability to engage successfully in core and cross-disciplinary impactful research. \\nStudentships will be available in all our academic EPS disciplines, see http://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/ or Request a prospectus. \\nOur EPSRC funded students collaborate with other Universities locally, nationally and internationally. They also regularly benefit from exposure to expertise, culture and infrastructure within industry and other research users through non-academic collaborations (AstraZeneca, Airbus, BASF, Citrix, Eli Lilly, GSK, National Grid, Rolls Royce, Schlumberger, Siemens and Toshiba included). \\nThe Graduate School enriches the postgraduate student experience by delivering a tailored programme of professional skills training which enhances the professional impact and helps to ensure personal ambitions are realised. In partnership with academics, students across the College and the Graduate Students' Union, the Graduate School provides opportunities for students to meet each other at a variety of social and academic events, promoting interdisciplinary knowledge exchange, encouraging collaborations and creating supportive global research communities and peer groups. \\nApplications for PhD places are accepted all year through our online postgraduate research application form. Potential applicants are strongly advised to contact a potential supervisor soon after the start of the academic year prior to the year in which they are interested in studying before making a formal application. The College-wide postgraduate open day is usually held in December of each year.\", 'TractAir Limited is a highly innovative company focused on the design of airbrakes for\\nspecial applications. The company was established in 1985 to design, build and install\\npneumatic and hydraulic brake systems for agricultural tractor manufacturers, dealers and end users. Over the years, TractAir has diversified and, being design led, has designed systems for other applications including dockyards, railways, land trains, airports, off road vehicles, construction plant and equipment. Today, the company achieves sales of around &pound;3m, employing a staff of 27. Export already accounts for 95% of turnover, with sales to manufacturers of tractors, trailers, as well as through international distributors and agents.\\nThe development project being considered is to address the worldwide market covering the towing of lighter trailed units, such as caravans, for which legislation does not yet follow best practice. Tractair have identified an opportunity and conceived of a method to significantly improve the braking characteristics and safety of all types of ‘trailers fitted with mechanical ‘over-run braking systems’ towed behind any self-propelled vehicle. The new Tractair system will alleviate the problem of ‘jack-knifing’ and provide a safer, proactive solution based on the development of a compressed air braking unit.\\nThe new system will enable the company to diversify into a mass market, and generate\\nsignificant sales, both UK and export, and further improve our economies of scale. The\\nproject will safeguard the future of the company and will support the UK economy at all\\nlevels, providing additional valuable employment and revenue.\\nSocietally, the improvement in trailer safety will save many lives and reduce injuries from\\ntrailer accidents. The technology is clean being based on air rather than hydraulic fluids.\\nRetrofit installation will also provide caravan and trailer dealers with additional sources of revenue and employment opportunities.', \"The photosystem two (PSII) protein complex is widely considered to be one of the most remarkable and important molecular machines on Earth. It performs the incredibly difficult task of extracting electrons from highly stable water molecules to allow plants, algae and cyanobacteria to grow. PSII also produces the oxygen that we breathe. PSII drives the very demanding water-splitting reaction by capturing solar energy and using it to drive the oxidation of water molecules bound to a highly conserved metal cluster, made up of 1 calcium ion and 4 manganese ions, buried within the PSII complex. The oxygen that is liberated is then fed back into the atmosphere. Dramatic progress has been made in understanding the 3-dimensional structure of the complex so that we now know to a high degree of precision where each atom in the complex is located. We know that active PSII is composed of about 20 individual proteins, bound together in a lipid membrane, and that it contains a large number of specialised pigment molecules to harvest the solar energy, as well as small organic molecules to transport electrons through the complex. Unfortunately PSII is not a perfect machine; it sometimes breaks down, especially when the sunlight is very bright, and has to be repaired. To do this the damaged PSII complex is partially disassembled into a smaller complex, and the damaged protein is replaced by a newly made version. Without this special repair mechanism PSII would be quickly inactivated in the light and plant growth and oxygen evolution would be inhibited. The purpose of our research is to understand how PSII functions to split water, how PSII is assembled from its component parts and how it is repaired efficiently. Understanding these processes might allow us in the future to enhance photosynthesis in crop plants so that we can increase growth to help satisfy the ever increasing demand for more food and more biomass. This knowledge might also have applications in the design of new, sustainable herbicides or the design of new man-made catalysts that might act as 'artificial leaves' to provide renewable fuels from solar energy. Together with our collaborators, we have previously shown that PSII is assembled in a stepwise manner from smaller sub-complexes or modules and that these assembly intermediates also bind 'accessory factors' not found in the final active PSII complex. Whilst progress has been made in characterising the larger assembly intermediates, less is known about the early steps in PSII assembly. We propose to find out more about what is happening at this stage of PSII assembly. To do this we will employ a wide range of different experimental techniques and will work with collaborators around the world to maximise the return on the investment in time and money. By using a combination of genetic engineering and protein purification, we will isolate different types of early PSII assembly intermediate: some very early on in assembly when pigment molecules are first inserted into the protein as well as a minimal type of PSII complex, the PSII RC, that assembles later on in the pathway. By analysing the composition of these complexes we hope to identify new proteins that are required for assembly and repair of PSII. We have already identified two accessory proteins, termed Ycf48 and Ycf39, which bind to the PSII RC found in a cyanobacterium. We will employ a combination of mutagenesis, biochemistry and structural biology to find out more about their roles in PSII assembly, their 3D structure and how they interact with PSII. In addition we will use a special type of microscopy to detect the location of the PSII RC in live cyanobacterial cells to see where about this complex is found which will give us clues as to the site of assembly within the cell. Overall our research will provide important new information on how the oxygen-evolving complex of photosynthesis is assembled.\", 'Awaiting Public Project Summary', \"To develop a robust tool to scientifically prove coffee type and provenanceCoffee is grown at altitude between the tropics and there are two broad types - Arabica and RobustaTypically Arabica is highly valued for flavour, Robusta tends to have a harsher basic taste profile.The international coffee market is big and growing Consumption +2% / Value +5 % paAnnually 135 m 60 kg bags of raw coffee, is produced in approximately 100 origin countriesThis values the raw coffee market at c 30 B USD $However, a precise valuation is difficult, because every original coffee has a different priceThis price variation is called the differential.It is a premium which reflects supply/ demand and also perceived coffee qualityEG - Good quality Kenyan coffee could have a differential of $2 / Lb. So if the terminal market price is $2 / Lb a Kenyan would cost $4 Conversely, a low grade Brazilian could have a differential of – 25 c / lb. So on the same market the Brazilian coffee would cost $1.75We also have a market which is dynamic and erratic and which recently hit 25 year price highsSo in a competitive environment the skill of the coffee blender has become increasingly importantThe coffee blender can chose from many coffees, and mindful of the impact of the differential has developed what are called Flavour Families (FF)These are baskets of original coffees, which share very similar visual, taste and performance characteristicsOriginally, FF were developed to deliver consistent product through the harvest cycleHowever they are now used to deliver like for like product at lower costThe fact remains that 95% of the time even expert coffee tasters will be unable to identify coffees and recipe nuancesThere is no known method to scientifically confirm authenticity and provenance of 'mainstream' coffee productThe industry and consumer would benefit considerably from such toolsThe premise of this application is that original coffees could be identified via Microbial assessment\", \"The novelist, translator and critic John Cleland (1710-89) is best known for his first novel, the Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure (or Fanny Hill) of 1748-49, and for a handful of other scandalous texts, for which he was legally harassed and repeatedly threatened with prosecution. But he was also among the most innovative and intellectually daring authors of the eighteenth century, and his long and varied career illuminates the more general conditions within which writers of the period struggled to create an authorial identity. In this project I combine original archival research and the close reading of published texts to produce an historically grounded analysis of Cleland's self-construction as an author; and I situate that formation within the larger structures of institutional authority and conflict--legal, political, literary, and commercial--which defined the changing terms of professional authorship in the eighteenth century. Cleland's critical essays on the novel are among the first theoretical statements on the emerging genre in English; his deployment of the vocabulary and narrative strategies of sentimentalism in his first two novels anticipates the later ascendancy of the sentimental mode, with its revisionist valuation of new, less polarised, forms of masculine and feminine conduct. Moreover, my research into Cleland's relations with Thomas Cannon, author of a long-suppressed pamphlet in defense of sodomy, confirms the centrality of Cleland's ongoing interest in 'deviant' and transgressive forms of sexual identity. For these reasons, Cleland's troubles as an author--the arrests for obscenity, financial struggles, defensive self-justifications and critical attacks--while consigning him during his lifetime to the ranks of literary renegades, help us to see what was at stake in the literary battles of his time. Although in recent years his first novel has attracted considerable attention, particularly from scholars interested in the history of sexuality and gender, there are no critical studies of his authorial career as a whole, from his early novels and reviews to his writings on physiology, politics and the origins of language. By tracing the thematic and figural connections that link this diverse body of work, I aim not only to offer a fuller and more nuanced account of Cleland's distinctive individual voice or literary persona but also to situate this in relation to changes in the literary marketplace and ideological climate in the second half of the 18th century.\", \"Viral infections often have negative consequences. These can range from common colds that interfere with our daily lives, right through to debilitating infections that can lead to disability (such as polio), cancer (such as Hepatitis C) and death (such as HIV). It is likely that all life on Earth has been continually plagued by viruses for hundreds of millions of years. In order to survive, humans and animals have developed new and ever more inventive ways to resist infections. These antiviral defences have accumulated over time, such that an arsenal of antiviral defences now exists within our cells. These defences are potent and organized. As soon as our body senses an infection, interferons (proteins that &quot;interfere&quot; with viral replication) are released that increase the expression of our antiviral defences. Viruses, however, have developed their own ingenious ways of overcoming these antiviral defences. Thus, the extraordinary diversity of viruses we observe on Earth today represent those that have adapted to thrive in this hostile host environment. \\n\\nNot everybody is equally susceptible to viral infection. Some individuals are more readily infected than others, and different people, infected with the same virus, can have different clinical outcomes. Many factors, such as nutrition, underlying health conditions, or previous viral exposure, can influence the clinical course of a viral-disease. However, if we are to ever truly understand how hosts and viruses interact, we must understand a cell's built-in antiviral defences. A better understanding of these interactions might help explain how viral epidemics occur and why some people die from an infection and others do not. \\n\\nIn this project I will investigate the interactions between viruses and the humans and animals they infect. Initially, I will focus on finding the novel antiviral factors that we humans have developed in order to resist infection by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1). Previous studies have shown that our in-built immunity to virus infection is often conferred by a single factor. Expression of such factors can be increased by interferons, and so they are referred to as interferon stimulated genes (ISGs). The identity and function of the vast majority of these ISGs remains unknown and so I believe that many more antiviral factors are yet to be identified. \\n\\nI have previously assembled a collection of human and macaque ISGs, most of which have unknown functions. In preparation for this project, I have examined the ability of hundreds of different ISGs to inhibit HIV-1. Now I will extend this approach to a wider range of retroviruses in an attempt to identify new antiviral factors. Crucially, human viruses have adapted to replicate in the presence of human antiviral defences so examining animal viruses increases the likelihood of identifying human antiviral genes. Conversely, human viruses are not adapted to replicate in the presence of macaque antiviral defences so screening human viruses using macaque ISGs increases the likelihood of identifying genes active against human viruses. I have already successfully used this screening approach to identify a new protein called CNP, which is abundantly expressed in the human brain and inhibits HIV-1 replication.\\n\\nDuring the course of this fellowship, I hope to be able to find more antiviral factors and explain how their mechanism of action helps humans and animals resist virus infection. It is my long-term ambition to use the information I produce to help design new drugs and treatments to reduce the impact of viral disease in humans and animals. This ambition will not be realised within the timeframe of this fellowship, but I believe that the work I will undertake here will lay the foundations for these future benefits\", 'We are asking for equipment which will allow us to see inside cells in unprecedented detail.\\n\\nCells are extraordinary, varied and dynamic and they make up all living things. A major focus of biosciences research is to understand the varying structures of cells, allowing us to understand how they are constructed and how they change during fundamental processes, such as replication. We also need to understand how cells interact with each other, for example as the immune system detects a pathogen or as nerve cells connect to create a signalling synapse. To do this, we need to be able to observe the architecture and internal structures of cells, as well as to pin-point the locations of important molecules, and how their positions alter as cells change and interact.\\n\\nElectron microscopes can be used to provide highly detailed views of cells and biological material and are much more precise than light microscopes. However, this brings challenges. The inside of an electron microscope is in a vacuum, in which living organisms cannot survive. It is therefore necessary to prepare a biological sample carefully before it can be studied in this way. The best solution is to freeze the sample and to maintain it in very cold conditions throughout imaging. This is called cryogenic electron microscopy, or cryo-EM. A second challenge is that cells are too thick to study in an electron microscope as the electrons cannot pass through a cell. To solve this, we make thin layers, which cut through frozen cells. These lamella are thin enough to image. Finally, cells are large and complex and the images taken on electron microscopes are therefore crowded. It can be hard to find what we want to look at. To solve this, we can use a technique called correlative light-electron microscopy (cryo-CLEM). Here, the things which we want to study are labelled using a fluorescent marker and we can observe the cells using a fluorescence microscope to see where the marker is. We can then make thin layers of the cell, focusing in on the region with the fluorescence signal and can image them in an electron microscope. By correlating the images from the fluorescence and electron microscope we can get much more information, combining the higher resolution of the electron microscopy with the targeted detected capability which comes from fluorescence labelling. Within our cryo-EM facility, we already have the equipment required to solve the first two of these challenges and we are asking for the microscope and associated equipment to allow us to conduct fluorescence microscopy under cryogenic conditions. \\n\\nThis equipment will be used by many researchers from across Oxford, to answer all kinds of questions about biology. They will image the sites where neurons contact each other and see how their molecules arrange as the cells are trying to find their way to make the right contacts. They will image the genomes of bacteria and see how they change when the bacteria are exposed to antibiotics. They will see how cells move their chromosomes around in processes which go wrong in cancer. They will understand how the compartments within cells contact and communicate with one another and they will observe what happens when parasites contact human cells and when immune cells contact pathogens. The capability provided by cryo-CLEM will allow us to see inside cells in a new way, to discover how they drive these, and many more, processes needed for life.']\n"

Covid has also caused a significant 22% drop in electricity demand from reduced commercial and industrial operations, forcing many stochastic renewables sources such as wind to be stopped, as well as new builds being cancelled or delayed, causing a 6% increase in efficient closed-cycle-gas-turbine (CCGT) plants to offer flexibility and grid resilience due to the changeable supply and demand requirements.
