You can pay an auto mechanic a little now for routine maintenance, or pay them a lot more later for a major repair.  The same idea holds true for your air conditioner or heat pump. If you don’t service your air conditioner or heat pump regularly, you may end up paying for major repairs later on and living in an uncomfortable home while waiting for those repairs.  energy usage chart  Without regular maintenance an air conditioner loses about 5% of it’s original efficiency each year.  So that 12 SEER unit that you bought just a few years ago could be functioning like a 9 SEER unit today.  The good news is that you can recover most of that lost efficiency through regular maintenance and studies show that with regular maintenance an A/C Unit will maintain up to 95% of it’s original efficiency.  Additionally, the cost of that annual maintenance is recovered very quickly in the savings on your monthly electric bill!  All Air conditioners and heat pumps require regular maintenance to perform at peak efficiency and we recommend our maintenance service 1 -2 times per year.  Our Maintenance Service is a thorough and extensive inspection of your entire A/C Unit.   A properly cleaned and maintained air conditioning and heating system will help your system perform at peak efficiency and avoid future problems. A dirty system works longer and harder, and costs more to operate than a clean one.  Professional Air Solutions offers a selection of planned maintenance programs for our residential and commercial customers in Clearwater, St. Pete and Largo. We can work with you to create a maintenance program agreement that will help simplify your life and keep your system working at optimal levels.  Ideally, maintenance and cleaning should be done in the spring and fall to ensure efficient operation and reduce the chance of system failures during the peak operation seasons.

Rating?  A S.E.E.R. (Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating) is the rating and performance standards that have been developed by the U.S. government and equipment manufacturer’s to produce an energy consumption rating that is easy to understand by consumers. It has a universal formula and conditioning that can be applied to all units and compensates for varying weather conditions.  The higher the SEER number, the more energy efficient the product is.

The diversified business consists of renewables, conventional and decentralized power generation, natural gas, energy trading, retail, and distribution. They supply around 26 million customers with energy. With their broad energy mix, they own almost 68 GW generation capacity and they are one of the world's leading renewables companies. They have an ambitious objective to make energy cleaner and better wherever they operate. With their strategy cleaner & better energy, we're transforming E.ON into a global provider of specialized energy solutions which will benefit their employees, customers, and investors alike. The development of technologies and regulatory boundary conditions, as well as the changes in customer behavior, are main drivers for a sustainable transformation of the energy system. It is still unclear how the future energy system might look like, but E.ON assumes the following trends: Changes in power generation - increasing additions in renewable capacity, decrease in generation and increase in flexibility for conventional power plants. ''Decarbonization'' of heating and transport - operation of electrical components which are supplied by increasingly CO2 free generated electricity (e-vehicles, heat pumps) Decoupling of generation and consumption - the consumption of electricity will be synchronized with generation to some extent via storage and demand side management. Distributed energy - the share of distributed generation will grow, e.g. photovoltaics, micro CHP (combined heat and power), which can even serve as reserve margin in times of low renewable electricity production. Integrated infrastructure - an integrated infrastructure for information and communication will be the backbone of such a distributed energy system and links together the various components in residential areas, offices, and industry. E.ON was founded on June 16, 2000, and is headquartered in Essen, Nordrhein-Westfalen, Germany.\n",

The HelloData platform is an open standard for sharing and transferring energy data.  MPARE is a subsidiary of the network operator Alliander. Alliander seeks to provide consumers in a large part of the Netherlands access to reliable, affordable and renewable energy under the same terms and conditions.  Home energy generation, electric cars, heat pumps, and intensive use of household appliances are increasingly becoming part and parcel of our daily lives. Having access to all this energy data and knowing how to use smart appliances and apps to influence our energy use is of great important to a sustainable future. Teaming up with the data experts of MPARE, Alliander contributes to speeding up the energy transition. MPARE helps consumers make the right choices that benefit individual households and the supply of energy in general. More information about the social impact of Alliander’s activities is available on its website.  MPARE believes that everyone has the right to access, understand, and control their own data. This will give consumers a better choice of measuring systems, apps, and providers, and developers greater creative freedom. It makes energy management easier and more fun for everyone.   Decisions about their own energy supply are increasingly taken by consumers. Logically, they make their choices according to what they need or find useful. This means that general energy supply may come under pressure if at one moment too much energy is being used, and the next too much energy is generated. Expanding the grid is not a solution because it is time-consuming and costly. Nor will it help address the challenges in terms of the quality and accessibility of new energy grids. A solution that does work is to better match supply to demand. This is where MPARE’s HelloData comes in.  HelloData gives consumers access to their personal energy data and control of who they are sharing this data with. By offering an open platform, MPARE encourages businesses to develop smart appliances, services, and apps for the consumer market. The platform is a low-threshold and reliable tool for everyone to use to manage their energy sustainably.\n",

Later, the ownership was reorganized when Westcon and LOS Gruppen joined together to form a 50/50 partnership. In western Norway's Bmlo, at Westcon's facility, our HighLift heat pumps are made. The Stirling cycle, which has been used for more than 200 years, is the foundation of the HighLift heat pump. This idea, which is primarily based on the idea of compression and expansion of a working gas at various temperatures, served as the foundation for Olvondo Technology's development of their novel high-temperature heat pump. As a result, thermal energy is transformed into mechanical work.\n",
