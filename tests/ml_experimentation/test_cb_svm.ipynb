Using one of AppUp's app templates it's easy, and adding functions like payments, GPS, push-notifications and IoT allows you to truly upgrade your business.  Traditional app development requires a big investment, which is the main reason why AppUp has almost 800 000 potential customers - in Sweden alone. Small businesses without their own app (and without huge marketing budgets), although they'd benefit from one:  - Shops can start their own M-Commerce platforms - Barbershops can let customers book appointments - Companies can build internal maintenance and booking apps - Entrepreneurs can start brand new app-based business - Businesses can launch social multi-platform services within minutes  Our main target group is small businesses, start-ups and private companies that offer some kind of service and has a need of direct communication with customers and/or emplyees. In Sweden alone there are 790 000 companies that fit into that description, and these companies will eventually need an app. Every study show that apps tomorrow will have the same role as websites have today.  There is no service like AppUp.

      "Description: The globalized world we live in allows us to exchange information instantaneously, but we often forget how difficult it is to send a simple package. Sending goods internationally can be extremely costly from a time and money perspective because of inefficiencies with logistics companies. vakargo aims to leverage the existing human network of world travelers to get items delivered in a timely manner and for a reasonable price.  The idea originated from the founders’ personal experiences when trying to ship items from the United States to friends and family in Vietnam. Frequently, packages are transferred from company to company until it reaches its destination, resulting in items being late, damaged, or missing. Christmas packages delivered to missionaries in India were not received until February, and were ultimately found to be empty boxes. Electronics sent to family in Vietnam were never  received. A drafting pen from Tokyo took 8 weeks to arrive in Oklahoma. Asside from process inefficiencies, there are also cost inefficiencies. Shipping small items to Vietnam can be up to $200, while delivering a television only 250 miles from Dallas, TX to Norman, OK can be more than $100. Because of these issues, people have resorted to utilizing their social network and “hiring” friends who travel to deliver items, but the opportunities are infrequent on a small scale. vakargo can create connections between people who need items shipped with people who travel in order to make the delivery process efficient, reliable, and of fair value.  Peer-to-peer businesses have proven to be successful across many industries, and vakargo looks to leverage the concept of social sharing in order to provide a much-needed alternative for people around the world. Though vakargo does not create “extra space” in a suitcase, it provides the network to access it. Travelers can provide their itinerary details and amount of extra space they have in their luggage.
